![Roland and the Dark Tower](/images/the-dark-tower.jpg "Roland and the Dark Tower")

I tend to be very critic with the movies and books I consume. And, if the ideas
behind them are any good, I get hooked and start to think of ways they could be
improved.

Since many people tend to canalize this spark in some form of fan-fiction, I
figured, why not do the same?

In this case I'll write about the Dark Tower book series, which I read a long
time ago. In my opinion, Stephen King's magnum opus ended up being too
ambitious, the fact that he is now sober did't help his inspiration either, and
I think he felt this urge to finish it somehow, after the accident of course.

To my liking, not many people disagree with me:

> [...] Wolves of the Calla, Song Of Susannah (UGH!) and this, The Dark Tower. They
> all seem to have been written in a rush after King's brush with mortality
> when he was hit by that van. What a waste of all the great material he had to
> work with. If I was rating the first four books, my review would have been
> five stars. Unfortunately...
> 
> Hated the way the vast world of the gunslinger kept getting smaller, with
> constant trips back to good old New York, to dabble in real estate and
> investing in Microsoft. Real friggin' epic. [...]

## My attempt at fixing everything

I loved the first and second books as is, they are brilliant, you can almost
feel the effect of Stephen's high state of mind, high... get it?. The Waste
Lands is where the story starts to deteriorate. I would have never resurrected
Jake and I would forget about the whole idea of 19, The Wizzard of Oz, Ka-tet
Corp, Angul Siento, Calvin Tower, Mordred and Dixie Pig. This all could have
been great material for a sequel of Salem's Lot, but here it felt weird.

This is how I would mixed and re-organize the world of the Dark Tower, based
entirely on content from the series.

1. **The gunslinger**. First edition of course, stays almost intact, with some
   tweaks though. The town folk, rallied by the preacher woman, has beaten and
   raped the bartender girl. She begs Roland to kill her. O Discordia! she
   screams before getting a headshot. The Man in Black also mentions the
   reasons behind following the Crimson King: *"You think that John Farson or I
   are on the wrong side. But what makes you believe you are on the right one?
   The Crimson King might have gone mad and recluded in the Tower, his ways are
   misterious, yes. But that has nothing to do with my reason to be with his
   cause. The problem with this whole good & bad thing is that chaos is not
   evil any more then order is good. Balance between chaos and order is
   necessary. With no chaos nothing would ever change or be created. Without
   order nothing could ever thrive once it is created. Conflict forces change
   and change is how progress happens. Sometimes in order to create, one must
   first destroy. The Crimson King is starting a revolution, and for it to
   succeed, the Tower must fall!"*
2. **The drawing of the three**. Pretty much stays intact too. When Roland
   looses his fingers laments with O Discordia. He doesn't save Jake.
3. **Wizzard and glass**. We learn about Roland's youth story at Mejis. Roland
   sees Susan die in the Wizard's glass and is devastated, blaming himself for
   her death, O Discordia. When the ka-tet returns from Mejis, they bring the
   Grapefruit orb and a kid with them, Bill, who is now an orphan because of
   the Big Coffin Hunters killed his parents. After Gabrielle Deschain's
   matricide, Roland and Jamie travel back to Serenity, where the sisters that
   run the place agree to adopt young Bill. They also give Roland a note
   written by his mother during her stay in there. In this note, his mother
   reveals that Marten has predicted that Roland will one day kill her.
   Although this has caused her to slowly lose her sanity, in the end she
   forgives Roland and asks that he forgive her infidelity to his father and
   betrayal of Gilead in return. Roland never talks about this with his father.
   I think this is a good closure for that story.
3. **Wolfs of Calla**. Oy joins the ka-tet. They find Calla (the far end of
   their known Mid-World) after chasing someone who was visiting the North
   Central Positronics Dogan. The Dogan becomes the standard metaphor for the
   internal workings of the brain of the ka-tet and Mia's possesion. There is a
   door they cannot open with the Crimson's King eye graffited. They are
   introduced to the town folk, dance the Commalah, etc. The kat-tet receives
   Black Thirteen from the cult that worshiped doors, the Mannis. Eddie sees
   Rolands past in it and how he will betray them for the Tower. Rolands sees
   all the ones he left behind because of his quest, Sussanah who can hold many
   personalities gets possesed by Mia, a demon from the Prim that inhabited
   inside the orb, that now starts to grow in her and wants the to steal the
   orb, reach the tower and free all the monsters that inhabitate the Prim. We
   understand why Roland is how he is, and why he wants to set the Tower aside
   to help this town, to redeem himself. His determination for the tower is
   succumbing now, he feels guilty, he is not as cold-hearted as he seems.
   Jake's death would be Roland's secret to this ka-tet, and that's hunting
   him, giving him nightmares, he tells no one but Talitha, the matriach of the
   town, during the sessions where she helped him with his arthritis. She also
   makes Andy, her robotic personal assistant, fond of telling horoscopes,
   promise that will help Roland in times of need. She dies of age, but gives
   Roland possession of her cross to lay at the Tower. At her burial Andy says
   O Discordia! They later, after an argument realise they have been keeping
   secrets from each other, and Black Thirteen is the culprit, so they
   reconcile and share mind (like the Dogan metaphor that will later be used to
   defeat the wolfs). Eddie gets knighted as a gunslinger, trainning with
   Roland's martial knowledge. Sussanah becames a sister of Oriza â€” women
   musn't bear guns.
4. **The wind through the keyhole**. Roland is hidding with the kids of Calla
   waiting for the worlfs. Want to hear the story of the young gunslinger who
   slayed a Werewolf? Asks the kids. He proceeds to tell a story within a
   story, begining with the little sisters of Eluria, when sister Jenna
   narrates him *the wind through the keyhole* while Roland is recovering at
   the hospital. The story is the same but the young boy slayed a werewolf in
   the swamp instead of encountering a dragon, with the gun and silver bullet
   that the Covenant Man gives him. He is later slayed by a dragon in the same
   swamp when trying when he returns to the enchanted forest looking to save
   another girl. Although Roland omits that part to the kids. Back in Calla,
   they defeat the wolfs, many folks die, including children. They notice that
   someone has given information to the wolfs. Eddie dies in this fight, he was
   not true knights after all. His body is buried with his gun, and a rose is
   planted in his grave like a gunslinger funeral. In front of all the new
   graves, Roland gives a speech, that ends with: O Discordia! The Tower
   demanded another sacrifice, now Roland is determined to end this curse. Ka
   is a wheel, and again, for saving the day, he must pay with blood of his
   loved ones, and looses his ka-tet again. They burn the jaw of the Man in
   Black, and ask the fire a question, the fire answers with a vision of the
   traitor visiting the Dogan. The traitor did it so that his daughters may
   survive. He begs for mercy before getting hunged. *I, Roland Deschain of
   Gilead, son of Steven, last in the line of Eld, protector of the Dark Tower,
   sentence you to die*. Sussanah get's finally possesed and tries to murder
   the gunslinger, in the fight manipulates Oy (again with the Dogan metaphor)
   to attack Roland, you looses an eye. Roland shoots Oy who dies in his hands,
   it's last word is *Tower*. He is left with a big scar in his face and from
   now on he will wear an eye patch. Mia escapes with the orb, but gets caught
   by And and later exorsised by the Mannis. With some remnants of magic and
   magnets they throw the demon through a portal in the Doorway Cave to the
   Todash. After that Sussanah decides to stay at Calla as a sister of Oriza,
   and maybe marries someone there to become the new matriach, since Talitha
   had no descendants.
5. **The Waste lands**. Roland returns to the North Central Positronics Dogan,
   with help of Andy, they open the locked door. A terminal tells is connected
   with Lud, where the wolfs come from. That is where the beam starts. We learn
   a bit about the myth of the guardians. They leave to Outer-World with Black
   thirteen. In Lud, we enjoy all the post-apocaliptic cyberpunk goodness ala
   Mad Max or The 100, graffities of the Crimson King eye and some slow mutants
   too. We learn that gangs stole kids to give them to Dandelo, a minion of the
   Crimson King, who roont them, a monster similar to IT, if not IT itself.
   Dandelo feeds from emotions, so it is Andy the one that kills it by
   self-destructing, saving Rolands life. Roland finds that there are good
   people still in this ruined world. The kids that returned roont, were helped
   by some good folk (someone saved my life tonight?). When he kills one of the
   pubs in a confusing episode, someone says: *you didn't have to kill him, it
   was his birthday today, O Discordia...*. Blain kills everyone and leaves
   following the path of the Beam.
6. **The Dark Tower**. Roland beats the train with a stupid riddle Curthbert
   once told him, at the battle of Jerico hill. We learn a bit more about it,
   the fall of Gilead and also the fate of Farson. After passing some of the
   worlds of other stories (the Tower is colapsing and all the worlds are
   blending), Roland is left in the final stop, Tower Station, the door to the
   Dark Tower, the only one in All-World. The old ones built this station and
   tried everything to open that portal, yet never successfuly. Blaine commits
   suicide. Roland has Black Thirteen that *weaks up* and starts to absorb
   everything like a blackhole, including him. The gunslinger has this vision
   of the rose that holds all the suns and all the universes that Jake saw in
   NYC, and all the lovecroftian darkness and beings of the Prim in between
   worlds. Wakes up in the crimson fields of Can'-Ka No Rey.


## My alternative ending

Once Roland reaches the Dark Tower, this is how I imagine the final encounter.
I put special atention to the opening line:

*Alone he was when he started his journey, and alone is how Roland reaches the
Dark Tower.*

The Tower is the apotheosis of all towers. It seems to be a monolith, sculpted
from a single huge stone. Black, of course. It is cracked, and some sort of
dense fluid comes out of the cracks. Blood of course. The Tower is bleeding.
That blood feeds the surrounding fields of roses. The Tower is alive, but in
agony, it's roots are drying up.

The entrance is a huge ghostwood door and depicts all the twelve guardians of
the beam engraved on it.

Roland knows what to do. Leaves Talitha's cross in the floor and blows
Cuthbert's horn to open it. The crows resting on the top of the tower take
flight, scared by it's loud and deep sound. And the door opens, of course.

The inside is void. There are no windows and no decorations on the walls. Only
spiraling steps. A hundred? Or a thouthand maybe? He begins to climb.

After a while, he is halfway to the top and takes some time to recover, then,
more steps. His hands touch something on the wall, some sort of pattern. He
realizes there are murals carved on them. Murals that tell the origin of it
all,  strange figures and symbols the Man in Black had shown him the long night
they met. He keeps going. More
steps.

To his surprise, the murals now tell The legend of Arthur Eld, the fall of
Gilead, and his life, Alain and Cuthbert, the battle at Jerico hill, the lovely
girl at the window â€” his true and only love Susan.

Eluria, the Mohaine desert, Jake, the Man in Black â€” he shivers. The doors by
the beach, Calla, Eddie, Sussanah, Talitha, Oy. Everyone is there.

It feels it's been a lifetime climbing. This thought clicked in his mind in a
weird way.

He finally reaches the top.

There is a strange typing machine on a desk, with a piece of writing in low
speech. He reads: *Alone he was when he started his journey, and alone is how
Roland reaches the Dark Tower.* â€” it makes no sense to him.

There is one last door. A red one, with an Eye painted in blood. The eye of the
Crimson King. It is already opened and it leads to the rooftop. He goes up.

The sunset has started. He sees the never ending sea of roses, laying under the
infinite shade casted by the Tower. Crows are back, standing on the ledge.

The Crimson King, in a human shape, wearing glasses and dressed in a red robe.
Hi is seated next to a lit furnace. The furnace has bores with the silhouette
of the guardians. He is piling up black rocks, stacking them in what seems an
imposible balance.

Childe Roland to the dark tower came! Long days and pleasant nights, sai â€” the
man in red says.

Roland, not sure what how to respond, says nothing.

You must be exhausted from your journey. So am I â€” adds with a smirk.

What do you mean? Asked Roland.

It's getting chilly, come, take a seat by the fire Roland, it's about time we
talked. We are going to have a clear stary night, it seems.

Anyways. Since I've thought about this moment for a long time, I decided it
would be best to choose my words very carefully, you deserve it. I wrote you a
letter â€” says as he unfolds a piece of paper he took out from his sleeve.

The Man in Red takes a deep breath. Ready?

Dear Roland â€” begins to read out loud.

I know why you came all this way for. You are looking for answers. But... when
we think we have all the answers, the questions change. So I'll give you
something better instead. Redemption.

You are not a bad person, nor a good one. ANd most importantly, you have not
forgotten the face of your father. In this level of the tower, I get to judge
that. You did well, better than I expected. And yes, it was worth it, all the
blood and tears. Your loved ones left behind, their names in your head right
now, and everything your ever cared. All this sacrifice, your existance, was
used to construct this tower. Every door you have opened in your life, has been
inside this place. It will withstand the eons of time, and your story will
prevail in it's murals, and in other worlds too, Roland.

The Crimson king takes a moment and continues.

This Tower is also my prison. It's been my obsession, a heavyweight burden, and
one of my most ambitious projects. 

One grows fond of every character and story that tells, each takes a peace,
they feed from you, they become alive! Casting a universe into existance,
watching it grow and most importantly, keeping it alive, is an exhausting task.
I was afraid of never be able to finish it.

But if I have to be honest, it is not trully me who creates, you know. To peek
in Ganâ€™s novel does not make one Gan, although many creative people seem to
think so. No writer is Gan â€” no painter, no sculptor, no maker of music. We are
kas-ka Gan. The prophets of Gan. Each prophet has a style. Mine is to put my
characters in dificult situations they have to overcome, and it changes them.

I'm afraid all of this could fall apart at anytime. You don't get an idea how
close I've been to death, and with that, the end of all. O Discordia! â€” the
The Man in Red laments.

Would I risk destroying your world as well as the other worlds I have touched
with my imagination, and drawn from? Would I risk it all?

We all have our tower, our epic quest. You are part of mine, gunslinger.

It's all in my mind, hunting me until I write it into existance. You, this
tower, everything...  I've tried to stop you, time and time again, but you
stayed on track in your crusade. I made you that way, Roland.
 
All roads are different, because all towers are different. Your rode to the
Tower is paved in blood. Mine is paved in ink. We have to walk it.

We know it demands a lot of sacrifice, it might even mean our end, yet it is
our duty to keep going on, for that we are destined to find it and climb it's
steps. That is our redemption and we pay the price.

How does this all fit in the grand scheme of things? Where is the Tower of all
towers? What would the nature of such tower be? Who will wait for us atop?
Will anyone be there? No one knows.

What matters is that this is your tower. You had to be here, gunslinger, it was
your inevitable destiny. It was very important for me that you made it. 

All things must come to an end, and this one story, your story and my role in
it is no exception. It's time we say our goodbyes, Roland.

I say thankya.

The Crimson King looks at Roland, folds the letter again and then observes the
constelations sprawling above. Roland does the same. All twelve guardians are
there, shinnig brightly, perfectly aligned around the tower. Polaris and the
sword of Eld can easyly be appreciated in all their's splendor too.

I know you are a bit overwelmed now. Belive me, this is not any easier for me
either.  I don't know how much could I bear if I were you. What universal
truths would I have to swallow once I get to my Tower... I try not to think...
It might be...  mmm... unwise.

Both stare at the fire in silence for what seemed a very long time.

Who are you? Asked Roland finally.

I am your maker, Roland. Consider yourself lucky. How many get that chance? I
hadn't, yet... I hope. I know there's someone greater than me. There always is.
Remember gunslinger, the greatest mystery the Universe offers is not life but
size. Size encompasses life, and the Tower encompasses size.

The gunslinger, plain as he is, doesn't like this talking. Shivers run through
his spine. 

I have many names, the Crimson King is one of them, it is how I'm known here.
But my real name is Stephen, Stephen King, see the pun? I'm a writer, a
pupeteer, the man behind the curtain â€” and gestures with his fingers as if
typing in the air.

Bullshit, you are a charlatan, that's what you are. Enough of this! I want to
hear no more.

The Crimson King shrugs.

First comes smiles, then lies. Last comes gunfire - Roland remembered. I'll shoot
you!.

The Crimson King nodded, accepting the deal. Go on then! There are other worlds
than these. Death is nothing but another door. 

Tonight â€” the Crimson King continues â€” redemption and death are tied together.
Death, gunslinger, yet not for you.

It is in your destinity to kill me. Do what you have to do. I will move on, I'm
mortal after all, you will soon find out. 

Just like that... What will happen after? â€” Roland asked.

I'll let you be. And you will walk through that door waiting for you
downstairs. Where it leads it won't matter to me anymore, another tower
perhaps! Perhaps the best hint I can give you is that Ka is a wheel. It
manifest as a cycle but it is spiraling in nature. One does not swim in the
same river twice. We get to the same situations in our journeys again and
again, but with new perspectives, we are not the same person we were one second
ago and you won't be the same person the next tower to reach.

So.. I'm ready whenever you are â€” said King.

Roland nods, stands up, draws his heavy, ancient and deadly pistols.

As the first rays of dawn appear in the horizon, he shoots the Crimson King
dead. The creature that claimed to be his creator trips and falls down. With
his red robe, that contrast with the pitch black color of the Tower, making it
seem as if he was ablaze while falling.

Now he stares at the sunrise for a while, it is beautiful. He then closes
his eyes as he speaks up the names of all his friends and deaths ones. He never
gets to notice, but new roses appear in the field for every name. After all,
every rose that surrounds the Tower belongs to someone whose name has been
spoken inside, in another story, in another universe perhaps.

Tears start to fall on his cheeks. A mix of relief and emptiness fills his
soul. This is the end of his world. He has other place to go and no one is
waiting for him.

Boys don't cry maggot! Hears Cort shout him in his mind, yet it echoes all over
the tower.

Once at the base, he notices that the cracks in the walls are sealed. The Tower
seems to be healing. He also observes red robe of the Crimson King, who is
nothing but bones now.

Is this a trick or are you truly dead? How many lies did you tell me? â€” says
Roland at the horrible sight.

A sandalwood door with a name in high speech on it's top â€” *Roland*.

As soon as he enters through the door and shuts it, and a new rose suddendly
replaces it.

Hope you like this ending better. As you can see it is heavily insipired by the
encounter with the man in black, which I think was breathtaking. The Crimson
King falling from the Tower is also a very memorable image. Maybe this series

I think this idea of meta-fiction was really interesting, but I didn't like how
King did it in the series. The only worthy finale. A deus ex machina.

Also with this twist in the story I have remarked the main ideas that are
present throughout all the books, and all these ideas entangled with the
meaning of the Tower:

* The O Discordia! phrase, that King said he heard in a dream.
* There are other worlds than these, many doors that lead to them, and death is
  nothing but another door.
* How Ka is a wheel, that also moves.
* Size is the greatest mystery the Universe offers.

The vast universe created by King is all his novels together, not just The Dark
Tower, and this way he would accomplish his dream of creating something vast
and complex as Tokien once did.
