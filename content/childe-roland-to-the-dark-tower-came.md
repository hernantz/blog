Title: Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came
Category: Personal
Date: 2016-02-05

Many of these books I read a long time ago.
Stephen King's magnum opus ended up being too ambitious and I reckon he felt
this urge to finish it somehow, after the accident ofcourse.  And, the fact
that he is now sober doesn't help either.

1. The gunslinger
2. The drawing of the three
3. Wolfs of Callah. They find Callah (the far end of their known Mid-World)
   after chasing the robot which was visiting the north central positronics
   post with some shardik's reference (plus we learn a bit about the myth of
   the guardians). , they prepare for the battle trainning, Eddie and Sussanah
   get trained by Roland. Sussanah becames a sister of Oriza. Commalah, police
   work, etc. He reseives black 13 from the cult that worshiped doors. We
   understand why Roland is how he is, and why he wants to set the Tower aside
   to help this town, to redeem himself. His determination for the tower is
   succumbing now, he feels guilty, he is not as cold-hearted as he seems.
   Jake's death would be Roland's secret to this ka-tet, and that's hunting
   him, giving him nightmares, also about his past friends and one true love.
   (Roland's past story is intercalated, he tells no one but Talitha, which
   dies and is burried, but gives roland her cross to lay at the Tower)
4. The wind through the keyhole + The little sisters of Eluria () (roland tells
   the little sisters of eluria story to kids while waiting for the wolfs,
   including the story about the story of the young gunslinger that slayed a
   werewolf? that the good sister tells roland while he was sick), they defeat
   the wolfs and hung the traitor. But Eddie and Susannah die in this fight,
   they were not true knights after all. Their bodies are buried with their
   weapons, and roses are planted in their graves like a gunslinger funeral.
   The robbot says: Oh Discordia. The Tower demanded another sacrifice, now
   roland is determined to end this curse.  Ka is a wheel, and again, for
   saving the day, he must pay with blood of his loved ones. The rode to the
   tower is paved in blood.
5. Wastelands. Rolands follows the railways up to Lud (were wolfs come from)
   with Oy, Black 13 and the Robot? In Lud, we enjoy all the post-apocaliptic
   cyberpunk goodness and some slow mutants. Gangs stole kids to give them to
   Dandelo, a minion of the Crimson King. He finds that there are good people
   still, he kills one of them and someone says, you didn't have to kill him,
   it was his birthday today, oh discordia... The kids that returned ruined,
   were returned by some good people (someone saved my life tonight).  In this
   book, Oy dies (his last word is "tower"), because of the injuries he
   received while attacking Tik-Tak, who also dies.
6. The Dark Tower. Roland beats the train with a stupid riddle Curthbert once
   told him, and he is left in the final stop, Tower Station, before Blaine commits
   suicide. There he find mentalists monks that were breaking the Beams, a
   survivor tells him that the Crimson King has gone mad and killed them all,
   and has gone to the dark tower.  He also finds the door to the Tower, the
   only one in Mid-World, and puts the black orb into some kind of placeholder
   to open it.

Here is my attempt at fixing everything: I would leave the first and second books as is, since they are brilliant
(you can almost feel the effect of drugs kicking in Stephen's mind).
The Wastelands is where the story starts to deteriorate.
I would have never resurrected Jake and I would forget about the whole idea of 19, The Wizzard of Oz, Ka-tet Corp, angul siento, Calvin Tower, Mordred and Dixie Pig, this all could have been a sequel of father kallahan.

Alone he was when he started his journey, and alone is how Roland reaches the Tower. The Tower is the aphoteosis of all towers. Black of course. The entrance is a huge sandalwood door and depicts all the 12 guardians of the beam engraved on it. He blows Eld's horn to open it and leaves Talitha's cross in the floor.

The inside is void. it would be pitch black if it wasn't for light that the open door behind him lets in. There are no windows and no decorations on the wall, only spiraling steps a hundred? or a thouthand maybe? that reach all the way to the top, where a very dim light suggests there is some sort of hole in the rooftop.

He begins to climb.

After a while, he is halfway to the top and takes some time to recover, then, more steps. His hands touch something on the wall, some sort of pattern, also blood, the tower is bleading, and that blood feeds the field of roses through its roots.
When the light that sheds from the top is enough, he realizes there are murals carved on them. Murals that tell the origin of it all, the legend of Eld, the fall of Gilead, he keeps going, more steps.

To his surprise, the murals now tell his life, Alain and Cuthbert, the battle of Jerico hill, his true and only love Susan (his heart beats faster), eluria, the desert, the man in black (he shivers), Jake (tears start to fall), Boys don't cry maggot! Hears Cort shout him. The doors at the beach, Calla, Lud, Blaine.

It feels it's been a lifetime climbing. This thought clicked in his mind in a weird way. Finally, he reaches the top.

There is a typewritter on a desk. Next to it, a poem titled: Childe Roland to the dark tower came. Roland reads it, although it makes no sense to him, an climbs to the rooftop.

The sunset has started. He sees the never ending sea of roses.

The Crimson King is seated next to a lit lamp.

Long days and pleasant nights, sai.

Roland, not sure what how to respond, says nothing.

You must be exhausted from your journey. So am I.

What do you mean? Asked Roland.

Take a seat Roland, it's about time we talked.

I know what you want to hear, gunslinger, what you came here for. You are looking for answers, but most importantly, for a redemption. I'll give you as much as I can of both. 
You are not a bad person, nor a good one. In this level of the tower, I get to judge that. But you did well, better than I expected, And yes, it was worth it, all the blood and tears. Your loved ones left behind, their names in your head right now, and everything your ever cared. All this sacrifice, your existance, was used to construct this tower. Every door you have opened in your life, has been inside this Tower. It will withstand the eons of time, and your story will prevail in it's murals, Roland.

This Tower is also my prison. I've been trying to destroy it all my life. It's been my obsession, a heavyweight burden, it's been one of my most ambitious projects, and I can't bear writing about it anymore. The pieces of the puzzle must fit, to balance the forces all together, of keeping you alive. I've tried to stop you, time and time again, but you stayed on track in your crusade. One grows fond of every character and story that tells, each takes a peace, they feed from you, they become alive! Creating an universe, watch it grow and most importantly, keeping it balanced, is an exhausting task. We all have our tower, our epic quest, you are part of mine. We know it demands a lot of sacrifice, it might even mean our end, yet it is our duty to hold it's existance together and for that we have to find it, that is our redemption. All roads are different, because all towers are different, my road to the Tower is paved in ink. It might be something that only matters to us, but in the grand scheme we are nothing but dust. But we have to do it. And where is the Tower of all towers? What would the nature of such tower be? Who will wait for us atop? Will anyone be there? No one knows.

The Crimson King looks at the constelations sprawling above. All twelve guardians are there, shinnig brightly, perfectly aligned around the tower. The sword of Eld could easyly be appreciated in all it's splendor too.

Who are you?

I have many names, the Crimson King is one of them, it is how I'm known here.
But my real name is Stephen, Stephen King, see the pun? I'm a writer. As such I get to
create universes, casts light and shadows in them, and force others to do my bidding as I work behind the scenes, behind the curtain, in my writings. It's all in my mind, hunting me until I write it into existance. You, this tower, everything. I'm afraid all of this could fall apart at anytime. You don't get an idea how close I've been to death, and with that, the end of this all. Oh discordia.

The gunslinger, plain as he is, doesn't like this talking. Shivers run through his spine. 
Bullshit, you are a charlatan, that's what you are.
I can't be fiction. Look I'm real, the floor is real, this tower is real!

I am your maker, Roland. Consider yourself lucky, how many get that chance? I hadn't, yet... I hope. I know there's someone greater than me. There always is.
Remember gunslinger, the greatest mystery the Universe offers is not life but size. Size encompasses life, and the Tower encompasses size.

See, I need you as much as you need me. We are both our nemesis and our redeemers.
All things must come to an end, and this one story, your story is no exception. It's time we say our goodbyes, Roland.

Enough, I need this to end and put my mind at ease. I'll shoot you! Roland said.

Redemption and death are tied together. Death, yet not for you, gunslinger. Death is nothing but another door. I will move on for sure, I'm mortal after all, you will soon find out. It is in your destinity to kill me. 

What will happen after?

I'll let you be. And you will walk through that door behind you. Where it leads it won't matter to me anymore, another tower perhaps! Ka, or destiny, is a wheel, it manifest as cyclic but spiraling. One does not swim in the same river twice. We get to the same situations in our journeys again and again, but with new perspectives, we are not the same person we were one second ago and you won't be the same person the next tower to reach.

I though THIS was the Tower!

This is YOUR Tower. You had to be here, gunslinger, it was your inevitable destiny. It was very important for me that you did it. I say thankee. 
I know you are a bit overwelmed now. Belive me, this is not any easier for me either. I don't know how much could I bear if I were you. What universal truths would I have to swallow once I get to my Tower... I try not to think... It might be... mmm... unwise.

Both stare at the lamp in silence for what seemed a very long time.

Stephen King knows it has been enough. They both know it has been enough.

So.. I'm ready whenever you are ready. Said King.

Roland nods, to accept the deal.

It's time I go, there are other worlds than these. Said King with a smirk.

I, Roland Deschain of Gilead, son of Steven, last in the line of Eld, protector of the Dark Tower, sentence you to die.
He shoots the Mad King dead as the first rays of dawn appear in the horizon. The Crimson King is nothing but bones now.
Is this a trick or are you truly dead? How many lies did you tell me?

As he stares at the sunrise, he speaks the names of all his friends and deaths ones. New roses appear in the field for every name, after all, every rose that surrounds the Tower belongs to someone whose name has been spoken inside, in another story, in another universe perhaps.

He can now see that right in front of the Tower there is a door, and it reads something in high speech.

*Roland*.

He walks in, wakes up in the desert. Ka is a wheel.

*The man in black fled across the dessert, and the gunslinger followed.*

I think this idea of meta-fiction was really interesting, but I didn't like how King did in the series.
I believe this is a better closure for the series.
With this twist in the story I have remarked the main ideas that are present throughout all the books:
* There are other worlds than these, and doors that lead to them. Death being one.
* Ka is a wheel, it's cyclyc but also moves, entangled with the meaning of the Tower.
* Size is the greatest mystery the Universe offers.
