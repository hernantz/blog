Summary: Ideas for surviving an open tabs buffer overflow.


## The interwebs and the power it holds
There is so much out there and just a click of distance.
Fun videos, new music, interesting articles, tutorials, blog posts, games.

So now I have lots of open tabs that I would like to close some day but there is
always new content that keeps being added to my information processing buffer 
aka open tabs buffer.

## Why do i even check reddit/hackernews?
Partly becouse It's addictive. Small dosis of information of stuff I like injected right to my brain. 
But mostly becouse, this way, I feel less guilty about procrastinating. 


## Ideas for surviving an open tabs buffer overflow.

[Triage mode][1] for new content is my current approach. If I find something that could be 
benefitial at some point, I throw it in the bookmarks limbo. 

> Bookmarks. That place where goes everything I will never read.

But until then I know is on a safe place, just in case. Also:

* Don't check for rss/newsletters/twitter/hackernews/reddit. You don't really need them, trust me.
* Fresh start. Don't reopen last tabs every session. 
  This will help you forget what wasn't important when you open the browser
  and read what is important before closing the browser.
* Limit browser tabs with a plugin.
* Use a read-it-later diggesting tool (like pocket), which also removes the comments and 
  ads cutter from your read.
