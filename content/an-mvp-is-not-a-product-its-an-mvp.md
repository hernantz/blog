tl;dr: Build, measure and learn. But don't avoid best practices afterwards.

Minimum Viable Product, or even better Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP from now
on), is a technique born in the Lean Startup movement to reduce the risk of
gaining validated learning, without spending too much effort, money and time in
the wrong project direction.

You build a MVP to validate an idea, be it for a brand new product or a new
feature in an existing one.
In this stage of the project you don't care about: tests, QA, copy-pasting code,
mocking the UI, security, code reviews, maintainability, scalability, etc.

In case this prototype is successful, you should go and build the product or
the feature to capitalize that validated learning, but this time, following
the industry's best practices, so it can be used in production by your
(paying?) users.

This last step is crucial. There will be the temptation of not taking it.
The consequences of not doing it are well known, that's why we have best
practices afterall.
The risk is low now. Money, time and effort won't be wasted. There is no excuse.
An MVP is not a product, it's an MVP.
