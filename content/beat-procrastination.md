How to keep focused on things you would like to get done, and you know 
they are benefitial for you and will make you feel good once they 
are finished, but you simply pospone and pospone day after day?

A friend of mine spent an entire day reading about southamerican soccer 
tournaments history and another entire day reading about technical 
specifications of different graphics cards.

We both know that being more eficient on how you spend your time provides
happiness at the end of the day and energy for the next.
