Summary: Currently there is a serious environmental problem: the trash.


## The problem

Currently there is a serious environmental problem: the trash. 
Trash is usually buried or burned to produce energy, but with high rates of pollution, 
which threaten the welfare of the people and all living things in general.
Sure the is recycling but supose a company that manufactures a product such as a sachet of milk, 
it knows it ain't easy to recycle, but will produce it anyways, and someone buys it anyways.  
Here is how the producer takes care of the problem that generated, by transferring it to the consumer. 
He sells a product, together with a problem (for the same price!).
Now, consumers seek to satisfy their needs with the product you just bought . 


Then once the contents of the sachet making, no longer need it, no longer has the solution, only the problem is : what do I do with this? . There are people who thought this issue and offer garbage collection as a service ( can be a public or private organization ) , that happen to take care of the waste from its customers. Here is how the consumer does not take the problem you bought, but will be transferred to the collection service provider .
We reached the end of the tour where this service provider should take care of the problem or hide " under the carpet " . 
It is worth noting that there are companies that recycle so they take what they used to sell it and the rest is buried or burned (where he was to stop milk sachets ) . What has happened is that nobody took care of the problem , but communities that pay with their health , flora and fauna and the cost contaminated kicked for future generations . Nobody took over, or rather not they should. We were all innocent and all guilty . So linear system .
 
Who is responsible?
 
## The question itself

Here is a crucial issue to clarify . The state does not fulfill its basic function 
in the free market ( which brings these producer-consumer relationships ) to control an 
individual does not attack the freedoms of others, if I kill someone in prison, what if not pollute? 
Remember also that , plants burial and burning of waste are high sources of contamination and infection, 
well then, why the state did not fine or closure ? The answer is for the simple matter 
of garbage collection is almost always a public service that is funded by taxes that do not cover 
the necessary precautions to treat garbage (made as cheaply as possible and even deficit).


## Smart Solutions

Note that many think that the problem is solved very high taxing producers who generate the problem. But this is not the most efficient and final.
This does not mean that the state must fulfill its role as guardian of the common good , except that the solution must address it on the other side.
Not his fault but the pig who feeds him .
 
Who provides the service of garbage collection, and ultimately takes over the final problem could do if you receive a benefit in return ( the trash is money ) . For example for a fee to its clients or not charging them anything, but get your winnings by recycling . Those difficult to recycle waste would not be something so useful for these companies , so they could charge differentiated rates take care of these , but always without polluting , because they would drop the weight of the law.
The consumer, analyze what you save buying products unfriendly to the environment, will pay to get rid of them and opt for more environmentally conscious products .
Companies also would be concerned to adapt to these changes by applying the design . Responsible and sustainable design as an activity responsible for environmental planning and human behavior , would play a key role in reflecting the life of the product, not only to consumption and alternatives such thinking as a service products , recyclable ( because sooner or later end up in the wild) and efficient . A clear example is the classic milkman who would pick the empties and let the full , supermarkets campaign to prevent charges in nylon bags , or leasing that is expanding , where the product returns a producer , who must be charge of their own mistakes if any.
It is seeking to create closed circles and green , and discard the old and poor linear system of production and consumption.
