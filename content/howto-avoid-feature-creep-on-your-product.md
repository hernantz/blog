Summary: Three situations that avoid feature creep.


1) Your product is so expensive to build that you have to think 
twice about adding/chaging something.
ei: space exploration, buildings
This is not necessaryly something good, high costs do not incentivate
experimentation, and experimentation is good (tm), but it for sure
contributes to avoiding feature creep.

2) Sos un diseniador de producto meticuloso. EJ steve jobs.
Busca la esencia del producto.

3) The third option is the scientific approach. To follow a data-diven design procedure. Track metrics. Do A/B tests.
