Summary: What I'm planning spending my time and (little) money on.
Status: Draft

I quitted my job. Got some money to spare (very little though). And lots of time.
In the following moths (starting today), I'm planning spending them both on:

1. Pet projects (some with millionaire aspirations)
2. On demand learning
3. Reading
4. Exercising


## Pet projects (4 hours a day) 
Got some really small projects like jay. And bigger and more ambitious projects like
Gotune and Foodly. I hope to grow as entrepreneur with the latter ones.


## Ondemand learning (4 hours a day) 
I'm really into Android development and Javascript. Also
some unix/networking/python/go/docker/salt things I will be trying, not
necessarily all related.


## Readding (1 hour a day) 
To practice my english, I'm readding `The Hitchickers guide to the galaxy`, and 
got some books from the mind of `Stephen King` and `Game of thrones` on my way. 


## Exercising 
Will do mostly running, 3 times a week (40 min each), and biking 2 hours on weekends.
