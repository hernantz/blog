## Abstract

Since high school I've always had the hunch that freedom was the obvious way
for a society to progress in terms of efficiency, equality, wealth, knowledge
and justice. I've been biased to justify everything as lack of freedom or as a
consequence worth suffering because of an excess of freedom.

But I later came to a realization: concepts like justice and equality are mere
ideals hard to reach universally. What is fair for some, might not be so for
others. Concepts like these, only make sense when applied in a pragmatic way in
a given time and place.

So maybe socialists, anarchists, conservatives and liberals all have something
to add to the table. To some extent, their claims might be relevant or absurd,
again, depending on the context of such claims.

Using mantras like seize the means of production, let the free market solve the
problem, education should be our priority, etc, are hollow and vague, without
proper context, hypotheses and facts.

So now I don't simply praise freedom *per se*, but freedom as a framework for
decision making,  freedom to explore different ideas, that on purpose or as an
unintended consequence, increase the chances of prosperity for our society, as
a whole, in the long run.


## ...And justice for all

First we need to understand some key limitations about the nature of our
existence.

We live and die in a universe where many things are defined in a way we do not
understand nor control and can change for that matter. The flow of time,
cancer, gravity, the weather, the certainty of death, the Creation itself [^1].

Because of that, we are not 100% free. **We are conditioned, limited and
biased** by what we know and don't know, by what we can and cannot do, by what
we perceive and feel, by what we believe.

Every day, all of us are making decisions that involve gambles. These gambles
are sometimes big like what occupation to pursue, whom to marry, how to invest
your savings or to have unprotected sex. Other times those gambles are small:
ignoring a phone call or trying a different menu in your favorite fast-food
restaurant.

The decisions we make are based on ideas of a reality we interpret according to
our limited vision of partial facts. We also need to factor the cost of
opportunity, you only have so much money or some much time.

In every decision we make, we take our chances. Every choice has it's
consequences. Since no one knows the future for granted, there are always risks
implied, unexpected outcomes. In other words, **success cannot be guaranteed**
for anyone and by anyone.

We can point to an idea of "doing the best according to the circumstances we
live in", and that in these circumstances, part of our future depends on the
quality of decisions we make, but other times it depends on our luck. Because
as it happens, in a sufficiently complex system, often those decisions are not
made by us, yet we bear the consequences nonetheless: the candidate you didn't
like gets elected president, a lighting strikes your home and burns your
appliances, your neighbors were noisy celebrating a birthday party and you
couldn't sleep the night before the final exam, etc. You can imagine that,
under these circumstances, **there is no perfect decision**, because the
obvious right thing to do might not always be an option.

In a sufficiently diverse society, **equality of opportunities is not
guaranteed** either. Some are born in rich families and some are born in poor
ones. Some go to good schools and some don't even go to school. Some suffered
an accident and some won the lottery. Some are deaf and some are blind. Some
are strong and some are weak. Some are handsome and some are ugly. Some were
loved by their parents and some were not even wanted.

Amidst the multiple factors that generate differences in a population there's
gender. Very basic and yet very profound in [it's impact on personality and
behavior][18].

And even if opportunities are provided, not everyone might be wise to take
advantage of them. Some act rationally and some act compulsively. Some might
love to travel, some just prefer to stay home [^2]. Some like to study or work
hard and some simply like to slack. Some only read the finance section in the
newspaper and some just read the horoscope. Some eat healthy and do sports
while others smoke and follow a sedentary lifestyle. Well you get the point,
**equality of outcome cannot be guaranteed**.

Seeing how complex, limited and fragile our existence is, would you say that
life is fair? And if not, who should fix it? How should justice be provided?
What does justice or equality mean? What if to benefit some, others have to be
affected negatively? Can a fair society be built? How would you define fair?
[^3]

But wait, not only we are interested in some form of justice, we also want to
have the chance to enjoy the fruits of prosperity. So we have to agree on it's
definition too.

Some societies may measure progress by advancements in human rights or the
level of happiness of it's individuals [^4], others by more [concrete
figures][11] like GDP, child mortality, use of green energy or number of
college graduates.

Maybe all of them are desirable, but which one is more important and how much
more important? Remember you always have limited resources, so there will be
sacrifices needed to be done.

Moreover, pray consider that there are multiple ways to measure things like
efficiency, innovation or even poverty.

If the right thing to do is not self evident, this leads to an obvious
conclusion: **there is no absolute standard of justice and prosperity**. The
pursuit of these universal goals [is futile][17]. They can only be approximated
to an agreed ideal that might change over time and is prone to subjective
interpretation, if no reliable metrics are provided.

Something we can do to mitigate this is to agree on a set of artificial
impositions and metrics that we are all going to live by. Rules of the game, if
you will, that are better, to our understanding, for the kind of society we
want to live in.

While these arbitrary rules might come from traditions, the constitution, moral
conventions or even scientific papers, they cannot be agreed universally, nor
will they be perfect. Ideally we would have the opportunity to be part of their
selection and later fine tuning somehow.


## Public enemy number one

Now how do get there? As it happens, in the search for justice, equality,
happiness or a better life for that matter, we come together with people alike
and form an organization, that would pursue the common goals we share.

To achieve those goals, different organizations might have different
approaches.

There are organizations that allow other organizations to co-exists, ie.
multiple newspapers, soccer teams, microprocessors manufacturers, NGOs, etc.
Anyone can choose which one to interact with, based on whatever their
motivations and possibilities are.

There are other types of organizations that don't allow alternatives to
co-exist. Governments are the most representative example of this kind.

I'm considering the government as an organization that defines rules and takes
measures that are for all to obey or comply (a.k.a forced collectivism).
Governments have the power of law enforcement, which other organizations don't.

Can governments be the right tool for the job, to become agents of change,
bring prosperity and justice to it's people? Of course they can!

Yet you might want to hear some aspects to keep in mind before you fully commit
to them.


### Governments are run by politicians

Lets assume politicians are honest and corruption is a thing of the past (left
behind with the roman empire). They would rather loose votes than lie to their
people and promise things they cannot deliver.

They were elected because they are the right choice for the job, not because
they are friends or family of powerful people, nor because they are famous or
charismatic and give beautiful speeches. They do what is correct and not what
is politically correct. They define themselves as public servants and do not
look to increase their influence and power and least they want to perpetuate in
it.
 
They convince people about their ideas by providing reasonable arguments backed
by real data, and not through costly advertising campaigns or feeding
sensationalism.  They do listen to constructive feedback and do not demonize
those who have different opinions.

Finally, they do not believe reality can be shaped by laws, but rather
understand that changes have to be implemented in scheduled phases and their
results tracked down.

We all know that this is asking a lot, but, even if you are not governed by
populist, dishonest or mediocre bureaucrats...


### Governments are the opium of the people

>
> <cite>― Pat Miller, [Willfully Ignorant][15]</cite>

See, it's not all about politicians.

Alfred Adler once said: "It is always easier to fight for one's principles than
to live up to them", and this is precisely why it is very common to have
zombies supporting visions that sometimes they don't fully understand or have
the interest in scrutinizing.

This hypocrisy is a golden opportunity for aspiring leaders to influence
people's desires and discontent.

Political campaigns nowadays are not that different from marketing campaigns,
where ideas of a "better nation" or "let me solve all your problems for free"
are being sold by messianic reformers.

In this sense, paternalism, understood as a mechanism of managing individuals,
often benevolently, but intrusively for sure, is a real threat for the
governed.

The state, as any other organization, is a living organism, that expands trying
to survive and perpetuate. There's a natural tendency for governments to grow
and freedoms to shrink, taxes are never enough, regulations lead to more
regulations [^5].

Soon the government becomes a services company, providing or overseeing
unemployment insurance, energy production and distribution, health care,
education, food stamps, housing, border security, you name it, taking decisions
for people as opposed to having each individual figure out their ways to solve
their particular necessities, through voluntary transactions. Now there is a
government-dependent horde of voters that need someone to fix their problems.
Decision making is transfered to the state. The costs, are never accounted for,
neither mentioned explicitly.


### Governments don't have enough competition

Every policy that any organization imposes is an experiment basically. If the
organization affects too many people (an entire nation for example), the
experiment feels a lot like putting all the eggs in the same basket.

Governments make decisions that are difficult in nature (basically they
regulate how people should live), which is very dangerous if there is only one
choice.

In this regard, governments have become accepted monopolies. More specifically,
they are thought to be *good* monopolies, managed by well intentioned experts
with grand schemes to solve big problems.

Policymakers might only be *"experts"* on some field but will never come up
with a sufficiently intelligent design for social engineering and problem
solving, that compares to the vast knowledge embedded in the cultural
intelligence [^6] of a society, which has developed a luck-affected
trial-and-error method for dealing with challenges on top of decentralized
flows of information.

Moreover, the way representative democracies work today resembles a lot like a
winner takes all kind of game. Sure you can change it every 2, 4 or 5 years,
but what voters end up doing is buying a combo of policies, or giving a blank
check to full-time employed senators, paid with generous wages, to figure out
new regulations. You like the minister of education but you dislike the
minister of culture? Want to keep the economic policies but change the
immigration policies? You cannot handpick what you want and what you don't
want, it's an all-in, pretty much.

In this sense, your choices are limited to picking an ideology and backing it
up so that it gets to power and hope the government does more of what you
support and less of what you dislike. 

Should something go wrong, the cost of switching to a different provider of
public affairs planning is too high and sometimes unaffordable for an
individual. The only choices left for free citizens are:

- To go outlaw
- To leave the country/state/province/city (if you are lucky you just leave the
  city, if you are unlucky you leave the country, if you are really unlucky
  you'll have to leave the region/continent)
- To change government (if you are lucky via elections or, if you are really
  unlucky, through a ~~violent~~ revolution)

Henceforth, **centralized and external decision making doesn't seem like a good
idea**, even if the ones that make those decisions are doing what they think
best, specially when considering the unforetold consequences of well
intentioned initiatives [^7].

What this really means is that governments as a mean of change, can be slow,
inefficient and a bottleneck for progress. But, above all, they are a very
risky choice.

The existence of the state is a necessary evil, but a constant menace to free
society if strict limits are not imposed to it's responsibilities and size.


## Possible solutions

> To have progress, you want a system that is competitive, not one that is
> dominated by a single power.
>
> <cite>― Joel Mokyr, [Why the Industrial Revolution didn't happen in China][5]</cite>.


The important thing to note here is that even if the government is the chosen
agent of change, the odds of succeeding with top-down central planning are
going to be low, compared to a society where decentralized experimentation and
discord are the core values.

**A society that tests it's ideas constantly**, enabled by freedom
(understood as a very limited set of artificial impositions [^8]), and guided
by humility (necessary to accept that one does not have all the answers), will
see higher chances of success over those who do not have a framework of
constant improvement that challenges *status quo*.

This is precisely what free markets propose and, to some extent, accomplish.
Non profit and for-profit organizations compete openly to achieve their goals
through transactions and resource management, trying to influence one another,
in a profit and loss system.

A handful of governments are also implementing some form of social
experimentation to test ideas and their impact and help reduce the risks of new
legislation.

Consider the controversial example of universal basic income, in which people
are given money for the sole reason of being alive, no strings attached. This
idea brings up many intriguing possibilities, like reducing extreme poverty,
simplifying governmental aid programs, but at the risk of letting people slack
and spend the money on vices or simply bankrupt the system. How much money, how
often, etc, are questions hard to answer. Pilot studies are being run by
[governments][22] and [NGOs][23] alike with randomly chosen samples of citizens
to confirm hypotheses, before claiming it as a genius or stupid plan.

Lastly, the closer the government is to it's governed, the better. Prefer local
institutions over federal governments and direct democracy to help reduce
collateral damages and the gap between what the sate does and what people want.
This way, lots of [small and independent governments][24] can act as
socio-economic labs running experiments simultaneously. Cities could be a
minimum, viable and independent unit of government.


## Conclusion

There is no absolute standard of justice and progress. Justice should be
provided and progress should be sought in ways that compete with other views
or understandings of the same concepts.

The availability of choices cannot guarantee, but increases the chances of
prosperity in a free society, by enabling ideas to be probed in competition
with other alternatives.

In the long term, and even in an unfair system, competition is what drives
progress, while centralized planning is the public enemy number one in this
regard.

It's the competition, stupid [^9].


[^1]: "There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly
      what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear
      and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is
      another theory which states that this has already happened."

      ― Douglas Adams, [The Restaurant at the End of the Universe][3]

[^2]: "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many
      of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome,
      charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in
      one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."

      ― Mark Twain, [The Innocents Abroad/Roughing It][9]

[^3]: The [container revolution][21] increased world's trade level and
      productivity enormously.  Within 5 years of “containerization,” trade
      among nations increased 320%; within 20 years, trade increased by 790%.
      In 1965, before containerization, a crew could move 1.7 tons of goods
      per hour. After containerization, a crew could move 30 tons per hour — a
      17.6x increase in productivity.  Prior to their introduction, cargo
      shipping was a labor intensive job, requiring multiple packing and
      unpacking of the goods.  The container revolution was of course opposed
      by unions whose jobs would be affected/replaced by automated cranes.
      What should be done in cases like this, where automation and
      standardization affects workers but benefits the productivity of a
      nation? Going further, what would be a just policy for fair trade? When
      is it ok to apply protectionism? Should it be done at national level?
      Regional level? For how long?

[^4]: [Gross National Happiness][8]: The term was coined in 1972 by Bhutan's
      fourth Dragon King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck. Originally the phrase
      represented a commitment to building an economy that would serve Bhutan's
      culture based on Buddhist spiritual values, instead of western material
      development gauged by gross domestic product (GDP).

[^5]: The effects of regulation -- both benefits and costs -- are difficult to
      measure, particularly when considered in the aggregate. As a result,
      analysts often turn to indirect proxies to understand the reach and
      impact of regulations over time. Some of the statistics used to track
      aggregate regulatory activity over time are presented [here][16].

[^6]: Apparently we tend to overstate the importance of the individual genius
      or leader while understating the gradual, cumulative nature of
      change. The Evolution of Everything, a book by Matt Ridley, argues that
      we observe the decentralized, incremental, trial-and-error process of
      evolution in all human endeavors, including culture, law, business, and
      technology. All this learning and knowledge is condensed in the
      [Cultural Intelligence][13] of a society.
      This might also explain why top-down solutions to alleviate extreme
      poverty are [often ineffective][19].

[^7]: Plans not always go as expected. Sometimes this is because the solution
      was narrow-focused on solving just one side of the equation, and the
      solution backfires because affected agents react. For example, a minimum
      wage law is focused in getting workers paid more, yet this could
      increase prices consumers have to pay and increase the willingness of
      shops to [replace employees with self-service kiosks][7], affecting
      existing a future employees who were supposed to be benefited by this
      regulation.
      Another example is environmental legislation, that forces industries to
      use/sell energy efficient products, in hopes of reducing energy
      consumption and pollution, just to later find out that this leads to an
      overall [greater demand of energy][20].

[^8]: [Innovation][11] is often threatened by regulators who require licenses
      or interfere with it through incentives and subsidies.  Napoleon
      Bonaparte said: "My motto has always been: A career open to all talents,
      without distinctions of birth", meaning that every person should not
      have artificial impositions or obstacles that prevent them from pursuing
      a career/goal, should they have the opportunity and capacity to do it.

[^9]: "It's the competition, stupid" is a slight variation of the phrase ["It's
      the economy, stupid"][2]. At some point I even thought on putting
      "Competition motherfucker, do you speak it?".
