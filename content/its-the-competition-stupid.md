## Abstract

I'm a libertarian who doesn't believe in justice, meritocracy, governments
or free market. I just believe that higher degrees of freedom increase the
chances of prosperity for the society, as whole, in the long run.

Since high school I've always had the hunch that freedom was the obvious way for
a society to progress in terms of efficiency, equality, wealth, knowledge and
justice. I've been biased to justify everything as lack of freedom or as a
consequence worth suffering because of an excess of freedom.

I'm writing this post not to convince you of becoming a libertarian but to find
a rational explanation on why I consider myself a libertarian and why I would
continue to choose being one.


## ...And justice for all

First we need to understand some key limitations about the nature of our existence.

We live and die in a universe where many things are defined in a way we do not
understand nor control and can change for that matter. The flow of time, the
laws of physics, the birth and death of stars, the Creation itself [^3].

Because of that, we are not 100% free. **We are conditioned, limited and
biased** by what we know and don't know, by what we can and cannot do, by what
we perceive and feel, by what we believe.

Every day, all of us are making decisions that involve gambles. These gambles
are sometimes big like what occupation to pursue, whom to marry, how to invest
your savings or to have unprotected sex. Other times those gambles are small:
ignoring a phone call or trying a menu in your favorite fast-food restaurant.

The decisions we make are based on ideas of a reality we interpret according to
our limited vision of partial facts. There is also the cost of opportunity, you
only have so much money or some much time.

In every decision you make, you take your chances. Since no one knows the
future for granted, there are always risks implied, unexpected outcomes. In
other words, **success cannot be guaranteed**.

You can imagine that there is no perfect decision. We can point to an idea of
"doing the best according to the circumstances we live in", and that in these
circumstances, some of our future depends on the quality of decisions we make,
and at times it depends on our luck. Because as it happens, in a sufficiently
complex system, often those decisions are not made by us, yet we bear the
consequences nonetheless: the candidate you didn't like gets elected president,
a lighting strikes your home and burns your appliances, your neighbors were
noisy celebrating a birthday and you couldn't sleep the night before the final
exam, etc.

In a sufficiently diverse society, **equality of opportunities is not
guaranteed** either. Some are born in rich families and some are born in poor
ones. Some go to good schools and some don't even go to school. Some suffered
an accident and some won the lottery. Some are deaf some are blind. Some are
strong and some are weak. Some are handsome and some are ugly. Some were loved
by their parents and some were not wanted.

And even if opportunities are provided, not everyone might be wise to take
advantage of them. Some act rationally and some act compulsively. Some like to
study or work hard and some simply like to slack. Some only read the finance
section in the newspaper and some just read the horoscope. Some eat healthy and
do sports while others smoke and follow a sendentary lifestyle. Well you get
the point, **equality of outcome cannot be guaranteed**.

Seeing how complex and fragile our existence is, would you say that life is
fair? And if not, who should fix it? How should justice be provided? What does
justice or equality mean? What if to benefit some, others have to be affected
negatively? Can a fair society be built? How would you define fair?

But wait, not only we are interested in some form of justice, we also want to
have the chance to enjoy the fruits of prosperity. So we have to agree on it's
definition too.

Some societies may meassure progess by advancements in human rights or the
level of happiness of it's individuals [^8], others by more concrete figures
like GDP, child mortality or number of college graduates. Moreover, pray
consider that there are multiple ways to meassure things like efficiency,
innovation or poverty.

Maybe all of them are desirable, but which one is more important and how much
more important? Remember you always have limited resources, so there will be
sacrifices needed to be done.

**There is no absolute standard of justice and prosperity**. The pursuit of
universal justice, equality and happiness for that matter, is futile. They can
only be approximated to an agreed ideal that might change over time and is
prone to subjective interpretation, if no reliable metrics are provided.

The only thing left for us is to agree on a set of artificial impositions that
we are all going to live by and that are better, to our understanding, for the
kind of society we want to live in. While these arbitrary impositions cannot be
agreed universally, ideally, we would have the capability to be part of their
selection somehow.


## Public enemy number one
I'm considering the government as an organization that defines rules and takes measures that are for all to obey or comply.
Goverments have the power of law enforcement, which other organizations don't.

Concepts like justice and equality are mere ideals hard to reach universally. What is fair
for some, might not be so for others. They only make sense when applied in a pragmatic way in a
given time and place.

Now how do get there? As it happens, in the search for justice, equality, happiness or a better life for that matter,
we come together with people alike and form organization.

Kinds of organizations:

* There are aspects that allow choices to co-exists i.e multiple newspapers, soccer teams, brands of cookies, etc.
Anyone can choose based on whatever their motivations and possibilities are.
* There are other things that don't allow other alternatives to co-exist. Governments are the most representative example of this kind.


### Governments are run by politicians
Governments are the opium of the people.

Lets assume politicians
- Are honest and corruption is a thing of the past (left behind with the roman empire)
- They do what is correct and not what is politically correct.
- They do not promise things they cannot deliver.
- The are honest and would rather loose votes than lie to their people.
- They were elected because they are the right choice for the job, not because they are relatives or friends with powerful people,
nor because they are famous or charismatic and give beautiful speeches.
- They convince people about their ideas by providing reasonable arguments backed by real data, and not through costly advertising campaings
or feeding sensationalism.
- They define themselves as public servants and do not look to increase their influese and power and least they want to perpetuate in it.
- They do listen to constructive feedback and do not demonize those who have different opinions.
- They do not believe reality can be shaped by laws, but rather understand that changes have to be implemented in phases and tracked down.

So, even if you are not governed by populist, dishonest or mediocre burocrats...

Demagogy + populism + sensationalism + Aristotle

Politicians tend to think that laws rule reality, and ban drugs consumption and commerce, which created
corruption and addicts cannot be treated since they don't fit in government budgets and since it's an ilegal
activity it cannot be tracked?.

### Governments don't have enough competition

Goverments are thought to be good monopolies

http://blog.ycombinator.com/moving-forward-on-basic-income
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/business/economy/universal-basic-income-poverty.html

There's a natural tendency for goverments to grow and freedoms to shrink.
The government can default but not disappear. That is not fair with other competitors.

Every policy that any organization imposes is an experiment basically. If the
organization affects too many people, the experiment feels a lot like puting
all the eggs in the same basket. Governments make decisions that are difficult
in nature (basically they regulate how people should live), which is very
dangerous if there is only one choice. Henseforth, centralized and external
decision making doesn't seem like a good idea. Governments should be as atomic
as possible.

See education, stupid regulations (gender on boards), clean energy, prohibition
of drugs. Unforetold consequences of well [intentioned initiatives][7].

The cost of switching to a different provider of public services is too high
and sometimes unaffordable for a member of a society.
The only choices left are:
- You leave the country/state/province/city (if you are lucky you just leave the city, if you are unluky you leave the country, if you are really unluky you'll have to leave the region/continent)
- You go outlaw
- You change your government (if you are luky via elections or, if you are really unluky, via a revolution)

Much more is achieved by lots of trial an error experiments rather than a single big plan

Should employers be required to pay men and women the same salary for the same
job, or are there too many variables such as education, incentives or experience
that determine a fair salary?. Should employers be required to have a percentage
of their workforce be women or black, or employees should be hired and valued
regardless of their gender or the color of their skin?


### Hypocrisy

> It is always easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.
>
> Alfred Adler

People think everything is free until they have to pay for it. When the
government intervenes, is doesn't have that direct impact. If you care about
something, there is for sure a way you can help, without forcing everyone else
to commit as you.

## Possible solutions

> To have progress, you want a system that is competitive, not one that is dominated by a single power.
>
> <cite>Joel Mokyr, [Why the Industrial Revolution didn't happen in China][5]</cite>.


1. The pinnacle of competition: ciudades estado
   Cities should become laboratories of social and economic experiments.
   http://cityobservatory.org/about/
   http://www.seasteading.org/
   The amount of power an organization should have should be inversely
   proportional to the amount of people it affects or controls. In other words give
   more power to local governments over federal governments.
2. Virtual worlds.
   Let's face it, the future is [non-human][6]. Artificial beings will rule eventually,
   and the only place left for mankind in the evolution race is to somehow merge with these superior forms of
   life. Inmersive virtual reality offers an interesting solution to how this
   process should happen, by hosting our human brains as software and letting us
   live as gods in our own universe.


## Conclusion

There is no absolute standard of justice. Justice should be provided in ways
that competes with other views or understandings of the same concept.

In the long term, and even in an unfair system, competition is what drives
progress.

Centralized planning can be the public enemy number one.

The availability of choices cannot guarantee, but increases the chances of
prosperity in a free society by enabling ideas to be probed in competition with
other alternatives.

It's the competition, [stupid][2].


## Notes
As John Hick once stated, God allows suffering, by creating us "imperfect and immature", so
that humanity might grow and develop towards a genuine understanding and perception of the Creation.
This could only be accomplished with free will, since otherwise, if we were either perfect or we had
only one choice, our existence wouldn't be of much value.

There was no justice for dinosaurs. Even when they might have done everything
they could in terms of adaptation through millions of years of evolution, they
couldn't survive a gigantic meteorite (something that doesn't frequently and
was impossible to anticipate).  Again, many factors one does not control.

These make the very reason why meritocracy, the socialist paradise or Adam
Smith's invisible hand are all utopian ideals impossible to be reached in a
society.

Recordemos que la meritocracia no existe, ya que no es facil asegurar que el mas apto
termine logrando los mejores resultados, puede pasar que alguien tenga mas suerte, mas influencias,
o haya estado bajo tierra cuando cayo el metiorito.

A career open to all talents: every person should not have artificial impositions or obstacles that prevent
them from pursuing a career/goal, should they have the opportunity and capacity to do it.


There are two primal fears in modern societies:

1. Monopolies: concentration of power in evil people that could get privileges.
2. Inequality and Lack of opportunities: As a source of stagnation and injustice.

Instead of monopolies, we should think about the things that limit competition:

- Rules that protect them (bureaucracy, laws, regulations, minimum wages, etc)
- Corruption and mafia, usually hand in hand with a bigger power that permits these violations.
- Lack of investment in technology that could provide alternatives in case of the so called "natural monopolies"
- It works well and it's efficient
- Accepted because it's powers are limited and can be changed every now and then (like governments)

      what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and
      be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.
      There is another theory which states that this has already happened."

      fourth Dragon King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck. Originally the phrase represented
      a commitment to building an economy that would serve Bhutan's culture based on
      Buddhist spiritual values, instead of western material development gauged by
      gross domestic product (GDP).
