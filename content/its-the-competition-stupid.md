Summary: Why freedom increases the chances of prosperity.

## Abstract

Since high school I've always had the hunch that freedom was the obvious way
for a society to progress in terms of efficiency, equality, wealth, knowledge
and justice. I've been biased to justify everything as lack of freedom or as a
consequence worth suffering because of an excess of freedom.

But I later came to a realization: concepts like justice and equality are mere
ideals hard to reach universally. What is fair for some, might not be so for
others. Concepts like these, only make sense when applied in a pragmatic way in
a given time and place.

So maybe socialists, anarchists, conservatives and liberals all have something
to add to the table. To some extent, their claims might be relevant or absurd,
again, depending on the context of such claims.

Using mantras like seize the means of production, let the free market solve the
problem, education should be our priority, etc, are hollow and vague, without
proper context, hypotesis and facts.

So now I don't simply praise freedom per se, but freedom to explore different
ideas, freedom as a framework for decision making, that on purpose or as an
unintended consequence, increases the chances of prosperity for our society, as
a whole, in the long run.


## ...And justice for all

First we need to understand some key limitations about the nature of our
existence.

We live and die in a universe where many things are defined in a way we do not
understand nor control and can change for that matter. The flow of time, the
laws of physics, the weather, the certanty of death, the Creation itself [^3].

Because of that, we are not 100% free. **We are conditioned, limited and
biased** by what we know and don't know, by what we can and cannot do, by what
we perceive and feel, by what we believe.

Every day, all of us are making decisions that involve gambles. These gambles
are sometimes big like what occupation to pursue, whom to marry, how to invest
your savings or to have unprotected sex. Other times those gambles are small:
ignoring a phone call or trying a different menu in your favorite fast-food
restaurant.

The decisions we make are based on ideas of a reality we interpret according to
our limited vision of partial facts. We also need to factor the cost of
opportunity, you only have so much money or some much time.

In every decision we make, we take our chances. Every choice has it's
consequences. Since no one knows the future for granted, there are always risks
implied, unexpected outcomes. In other words, **success cannot be guaranteed**
for anyone and by anyone.

We can point to an idea of "doing the best according to the circumstances we
live in", and that in these circumstances, part of our future depends on the
quality of decisions we make, but other times it depends on our luck. Because
as it happens, in a sufficiently complex system, often those decisions are not
made by us, yet we bear the consequences nonetheless: the candidate you didn't
like gets elected president, a lighting strikes your home and burns your
appliances, your neighbors were noisy celebrating a birthday party and you
couldn't sleep the night before the final exam, etc. You can imagine that,
under these circumstances, **there is no perfect decision**, because the
obvious one might not always be an option.

In a sufficiently diverse society, **equality of opportunities is not
guaranteed** either. Some are born in rich families and some are born in poor
ones. Some go to good schools and some don't even go to school. Some suffered
an accident and some won the lottery. Some are deaf and some are blind. Some
are strong and some are weak. Some are handsome and some are ugly. Some were
loved by their parents and some were not even wanted.

And even if opportunities are provided, not everyone might be wise to take
advantage of them. Some act rationally and some act compulsively. Some might
love to travel, some just prefer to stay home [^9]. Some like to study or work
hard and some simply like to slack. Some only read the finance section in the
newspaper and some just read the horoscope. Some eat healthy and do sports
while others smoke and follow a sendentary lifestyle. Well you get the point,
**equality of outcome cannot be guaranteed**.

Seeing how complex, limited and fragile our existence is, would you say that
life is fair? And if not, who should fix it? How should justice be provided?
What does justice or equality mean? What if to benefit some, others have to be
affected negatively? Can a fair society be built? How would you define fair?

But wait, not only we are interested in some form of justice, we also want to
have the chance to enjoy the fruits of prosperity. So we have to agree on it's
definition too.

Some societies may meassure progess by advancements in human rights or the
level of happiness of it's individuals [^8], others by more [concrete
figures][11] like GDP, child mortality, use of green energy or number of
college graduates.

Maybe all of them are desirable, but which one is more important and how much
more important? Remember you always have limited resources, so there will be
sacrifices needed to be done.

Moreover, pray consider that there are multiple ways to meassure things like
efficiency, innovation or even poverty.

If the right thing to do is not self evident, this leads to an obvious
conclusion: **there is no absolute standard of justice and prosperity**. The
pursuit of these universal goals is futile. They can only be approximated to an
agreed ideal that might change over time and is prone to subjective
interpretation, if no reliable metrics are provided.

Something we can do to mitigate this is to agree on a set of artificial
impositions and metrics that we are all going to live by. Rules of the game, if
you will, that are better, to our understanding, for the kind of society we
want to live in.

While these arbitrary rules might come from traditions, the constitution, moral
conventions or even cientific papers, they cannot be agreed universally, nor
will they be perfect. Ideally we would have the oportunity to be part of their
selection and later fine tuning somehow.

COMMENT HOW NATURE WORKS HERE.

## Public enemy number one

I'm considering the government as an organization that defines rules and takes
measures that are for all to obey or comply (a.k.a forced colectivism).
Goverments have the power of law enforcement, which other organizations don't.

Now how do get there? As it happens, in the search for justice, equality, happiness or a better life for that matter,
we come together with people alike and form organization.

Kinds of organizations:

* There are aspects that allow choices to co-exists i.e multiple newspapers, soccer teams, brands of cookies, etc.
Anyone can choose based on whatever their motivations and possibilities are.
* There are other things that don't allow other alternatives to co-exist. Governments are the most representative example of this kind.


### Governments are run by politicians

Lets assume politicians are honest and corruption is a thing of the past (left
behind with the roman empire). They are honest and would rather loose votes
than lie to their people and promise things they cannot deliver.

They were elected because they are the right choice for the job, not because
they are friends or family of powerful people, nor because they are famous or
charismatic and give beautiful speeches. They do what is correct and not what
is politically correct. They define themselves as public servants and do not
look to increase their influese and power and least they want to perpetuate in
it.
 
They convince people about their ideas by providing reasonable arguments backed
by real data, and not through costly advertising campaings or feeding
sensationalism.  They do listen to constructive feedback and do not demonize
those who have different opinions.

Finally, they do not believe reality can be shaped by laws [^10], but rather
understand that changes have to be implemented in scheduled phases and their
results tracked down.

We all know that this is asking a lot, but, even if you are not governed by
populist, dishonest or mediocre burocrats...


### Governments are the opium of the people

See, it's not all about politicians.

Alfred Adler once said: "It is always easier to fight for one's principles than
to live up to them", and this is precisely why it is very common to have
zombies supporting visions that sometimes they don't fully understand or have
the interest in scrutenizing them.

This hyprocrisy is a golden oportunity for aspiring leaders to influense people
desires and discontent.

Political campaigns nowadays are not that different from marketing campaings,
where ideas of a "better nation" or "let me solve all your problems for free"
are being sold by messianic politicians.

The state, as any other organization, is a living organism, that expands trying
to survive and perpetuate. There's a natural tendency for goverments to grow
and freedoms to shrink, taxes are never enough, regulations lead to more
regulations.

Soon the government becomes a services company, providing or overseeing
unemployment insurance, energy production and distribution, healthcare,
education, food stamps, shelter, security, you name it, taking decisions for
people as opposed to having each individual figure out their ways to solve
their particular necessities, through voluntary transactions. Now there is a
government dependant orde of voters that need someone to fix their problems.
Decision making is transfered to the state. The costs, never acounted for.


### Governments don't have enough competition

> <cite>Tim O'Reilly, [To survive, the game of business needs to update its rules][1].</cite>

Every policy that any organization imposes is an experiment basically. If the
organization affects too many people (an entire nation for example), the
experiment feels a lot like puting all the eggs in the same basket.

Governments make decisions that are difficult in nature (basically they
regulate how people should live), which is very dangerous if there is only one
choice.

Henseforth, centralized and external decision making doesn't seem like a good
idea, even if the ones that make those decisions are doing what they think
best, specially when considering the unforetold consequences of well
[intentioned initiatives][7].

Moreover, governments have become accepted monopolies. The way representative
democracies work today resembles a lot like a winner takes all kind of game.
Sure you can change it every 2, 4 or 5 years, but what voters are end up doing
is buying a combo of politicies. You like the minister of education but you
dislike the minister of culture? want to keep the economic policies but change
the immigration policies? You cannot handpick what you want and what you don't
want, it's an all-in, pretty much.

In this sense, your choices are limited to picking an ideology and backing it
up so that it gets to power and hope the government does more of what you
support and less of what you dislike. 

Now, you may be thinking, this is a problem every organization suffers from, so
why is that we bring this topic now?

The cost of switching to a different provider of public services is too high
and sometimes unaffordable for a member of a society. The only choices left
for free citizens are:

- You go outlaw
- You leave the country/state/province/city (if you are lucky you just leave
  the city, if you are unluky you leave the country, if you are really unluky
  you'll have to leave the region/continent)
- You change your government (if you are luky via elections or, if you are
  really unluky, through a ~~violent~~ revolution)

The existance of the state is a necessary evil, but a constant menace to free
society if limits are not imposed to it's responsibilities and size.

Governments are thought to be *good* monopolies

The government can default but not disappear. That is not fair with other competitors.

Governments as a mean of change, can be slow and inefficiant, they can become a bottleneck.

Should employers be required to pay men and women the same salary for the same
job, or are there too many variables such as education, incentives or experience
that determine a fair salary?. Should employers be required to have a percentage
of their workforce be women or black, or employees should be hired and valued
regardless of their gender or the color of their skin?

## Possible solutions

> dominated by a single power.
>
> <cite>Joel Mokyr, [Why the Industrial Revolution didn't happen in China][5]</cite>.


The important thing to note here is that even if the government is the chosen
agent of change, the odds of succeding with top-down central planning are going
to be low, compared to a society where descentrilized experimentation and
discord are the core values.

Much more is achieved by lots of trial an error experiments rather than a
single big plan.

A society that [test their ideas constantly][11], enabled by freedom
(understood as a very limited set of artificial impossitions), and guided by
humility (necessary to accept that one does not have all the answers), will see
higher chances of success over those who do not have a framework of constant
improvement that challenges status quo.

Does your society work as lab? Does it work through the free enterprise system?
Does it work through government intervention? A bit of both?

1. The pinnacle of competition: ciudades estado
   Cities should become laboratories of social and economic experiments.
   http://cityobservatory.org/about/
   http://www.seasteading.org/
   The amount of power an organization should have should be inversely
   proportional to the amount of people it affects or controls. In other words give
   more power to local governments over federal governments.
2. Virtual worlds.
   Let's face it, the future is [non-human][6]. Artificial beings will rule eventually,
   and the only place left for mankind in the evolution race is to somehow merge with these superior forms of
   life. Inmersive virtual reality offers an interesting solution to how this
   process should happen, by hosting our human brains as software and letting us
   live as gods in our own universe.


Among the cities this new world has to offer I would choose a libertarian one,
which one would you choose?


## Conclusion

There is no absolute standard of justice and progress. Justice should be
provided and progress should be seeked in ways that compete with other views
or understandings of the same concepts.

The availability of choices cannot guarantee, but increases the chances of
prosperity in a free society by enabling ideas to be probed in competition with
other alternatives.

In the long term, and even in an unfair system, competition is what drives
progress while centralized planning is the public enemy number one in this
regard.

It's the competition, [stupid][2].


## Notes
If history teaches us anything, it’s that governments are always right, and they always do what’s in the best interest of the people, even at the expense of their own political agenda. In every situation, the answer is always more government and more regulation. If there are six billion people in the world, then all six billion should work for the government. More, if we could. And there should be at least twice as many laws as there are people in the world. And with more laws means more lawyers, so it’s a double benefit. It’s a win-win for both the government and the citizens, which of course there won’t be because in this utopian dream there are no citizens, there is only the government. The best part is the taxes will be super high, but they’re paid in full by the printing presses of the Geodesic Dome Society. Full benefits, zero unemployment, no chance of being fired, and a world so efficient it would make Rube Goldberg look like Fred Taylor or Henry Ford.

Open cities project?
Search for committed suicide because socialism had arrived.
As John Hick once stated, God allows suffering, by creating us "imperfect and immature", so
that humanity might grow and develop towards a genuine understanding and perception of the Creation.
This could only be accomplished with free will, since otherwise, if we were either perfect or we had
only one choice, our existence wouldn't be of much value.

Although I'm against the governments making big plans, I might accept some of
it at a municipal level, where shit gets real instead of academia bullshit
about how everything should be handled.


Politicians tend to think that laws rule reality, and ban drugs consumption and commerce, which created
corruption and addicts cannot be treated since they don't fit in government budgets and since it's an ilegal
activity it cannot be tracked?.

There was no justice for dinosaurs. Even when they might have done everything
they could in terms of adaptation through millions of years of evolution, they
couldn't survive a gigantic meteorite (something that doesn't frequently and
was impossible to anticipate). Again, many factors one does not control.

These make the very reason why meritocracy, the socialist paradise or Adam
Smith's invisible hand are all utopian ideals impossible to be reached in a
society.

Recordemos que la meritocracia no existe, ya que no es facil asegurar que el mas apto
termine logrando los mejores resultados, puede pasar que alguien tenga mas suerte, mas influencias,
o haya estado bajo tierra cuando cayo el metiorito.

"tragedy of the commons"

The more you limit compteition and experimentation, even with good intentions,
the more you harm your chances of prosperity.

Monopolies:


A career open to all talents: every person should not have artificial impositions or obstacles that prevent
them from pursuing a career/goal, should they have the opportunity and capacity to do it.


There are two primal fears in modern societies:

1. Monopolies: concentration of power in evil people that could get privileges.
2. Inequality and Lack of opportunities: As a source of stagnation and injustice.

Instead of monopolies, we should think about the things that limit competition:

- Rules that protect them (bureaucracy, laws, regulations, minimum wages, etc)
- Corruption and mafia, usually hand in hand with a bigger power that permits these violations.
- Lack of investment in technology that could provide alternatives in case of the so called "natural monopolies"
- It works well and it's efficient
- Accepted because it's powers are limited and can be changed every now and then (like governments)
