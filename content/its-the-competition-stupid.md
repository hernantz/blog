## Abstract

I'm a libertarian who doesn't believe in justice, meritocracy, governments
or free market. I just believe that higher degrees of freedom increase the
chances of prosperity for the society, as whole, in the long run.

Since high school I've always had the hunch that freedom was the obvious way for
a society to progress in terms of efficiency, equality, wealth, knowledge and
justice. I've been biased to justify everything as lack of freedom or as a
consequence worth suffering because of excess of freedom.

I'm writing this post not to convince you of becoming a libertarian but to find
a rational explanation on why I consider myself a libertarian and why I would
continue to choose being one.


## ...And justice for all

First we need to understand something about the nature of our existence.

We live and die in a universe where many things are defined in a way we do not
understand nor control and can change for that matter.  The flow of time, the
laws of physics, the birth and death of stars, the [fundamental answer][3].

Because of that, we are not 100% free. We are conditioned, limited and biased by
what we know and don't know, by what we can and cannot do, by what we perceive
and feel, by what we believe.

Every day, all of us are making decisions that involve gambles, sometimes they
are big gambles: what occupation to pursue, whom to marry, how to invest your
savings, have unprotected sex. Other times they are small gambles: ignoring a
call or trying a new restaurant. 

The decisions we make are based on ideas of a reality we interpret according to
our limited vision of partial facts. There is also the cost of opportunity, you
only have so much money or some much time. 

You can imagine that there is no perfect decision. We can point to an idea of
"doing the best according to the circumstances we live in", and that in these
circumstances, we are responsible for our future. But some of that future
depends on the quality of decisions we make, and at times it also depends of
luck. Because as it happens, in a sufficiently complex system, often those
decisions are not made by us, yet we bear the consequences nonetheless.  

In every decision you take your chances. Since no one knows the future for
granted, there are always risks implied, unexpected outcomes. In other words,
success cannot be guaranteed.

In a sufficiently diverse society, equality of opportunities is not guaranteed
either. Some are born in rich families and some are born in poor ones. Some go
to good schools and some don't even go to school. Some had an accident and some
won the lottery. Some are blind and some are paralytic. Some are tall and some
are short. Some are handsome and some are ugly. Some were loved by their parents
and some were not wanted. Some are old and some are young. Some act rationally
and some act compulsively. Some could travel and meet other cultures and some
never left their home town. Some read the news and some don't even have
internet. Some eat healthy and do sports while others smoke and follow a
sendentary lifestyle.

This is the very reason meritocracy is an ideal never to
be reached in a society.
This is the very reason why meritocracy, the socialist paradise or Adam Smith's
invisible hand are all utopian ideas impossible to reach.

Seeing how complex and fragile our existence is, would you say that life is
fair? And if not, who should fix it? How should justice be provided? What does
justice or equality mean? Can a fair society be built? How would you define fair?

No absolute standard of justice.
Now these arbitrary impositions cannot be agreed universally.

To change some variable in order to benefit some, others have to be affected negatively?

There was no justice for dinosaurs. Even when they might have done everything they could in terms of adaptation through millions of years of evolution, they couldn't survive a gigantic meteorite (something that doesn't frequently and was impossible to anticipate).
Again, many factors one does not control.

Recordemos que la meritocracia no existe, ya que no es facil asegurar que el mas apto
termine logrando los mejores resultados, puede pasar que alguien tenga mas suerte, mas influencias,
o haya estado bajo tierra cuando cayo el metiorito.


Even in an unfair system, competition drives progress.

A career open to all talents: every person should not have artificial impositions or obstacles that prevent
them from pursuing a career/goal, should they have the opportunity and capacity to do it.


Impones barreras en tu empresa para que no cualquiera puede entrar, solo los que vos crees mas aptos para un puesto.
Impones barreras para limitar el accionar de violentos o psicopatas.

The only thing left for us is to agree on a set of artificial impositions that we are all going to live by
and that are better, to our understanding, for the kind of world we want to live in.
Ideally we have the capability to be part of that election.


## The good monopoly

There are two primal fears in modern societies:

1. Monopolies: concentration of power in evil people.
2. Inequality and Lack of opportunities: Someone should provide them.

Instead of monopolies, we should think about the things that limit competition:

- Rules that protect them (bureaucracy, laws, regulations, minimum wages, etc)
- Corruption and mafia, usually hand in hand with a bigger power that permits these violations.
- Lack of investment in technology that could provide alternatives in case of the so called "natural monopolies"
- It works well and it's efficient
- Accepted because it can be changed every now and then (like governments)

These roles are delegated to the government.


## Public enemy number one

Concepts like justice and equality are mere ideals hard to reach universally. What is fair
for some, might not be so for others. They only make sense when applied in a pragmatic way in a
given time and place.

Now how do get there? As it happens, in the search for justice, equality, happiness or a better life for that matter,
we come together with people alike and form organization.

Kinds of organizations:
* There are aspects that allow choices to co-exists i.e multiple newspapers, soccer teams, brands of cookies, etc.
Anyone can choose base on whatever is their motivation and possibilities.
* There are other things that don't allow other alternatives to co-exist. Governments are the most representative example of this kind.

I'm considering the government as an organization that defines rules and takes measures that are for all to obey or comply.
Centralized government is the root of all evil
Governments should be as atomic as possible.


Every policy that any organization imposes is an experiment basically. No one knows the future for granted.


### Governments are run by politicians
Governments are the opium of the people.
Politicians will do, not what is correct, but what is politically correct.
Demagogy + sensationalism + Aristotle

Politicians tend to think that laws rule reality, and ban drugs consumption and commerce, which created
corruption and addicts cannot be treated since they don't fit in government budgets and since it's an ilegal
activity it cannot be tracked?.
Governments believe that reality can be shaped by laws.

### Governments don't have enough competition

The government can default but not disappear. That is not fair with other
competitors.

The cost of switching to a different provider of public services is too high and sometimes unaffordable.
The only choices left are:
- You leave the country/state/province/city
- You go outlaw
- You change your government
Is difficult to change them or became a customer of a different
government. Governments make decisions that are difficult in nature (regulate how people live), which is very
dangerous if there is only one choice. See education, stupid regulations (gender on boards), clean energy,
prohibition of drugs.
Unforetold consequences of well [intentioned initiatives][7].

Much more is achieved by lots of trial an error experiments rather than a single big plan

Ejemplo de los containers

Should employers be required to pay men and women the same salary for the same
job, or are there too many variables such as education, incentives or experience
that determine a fair salary?. Should employers be required to have a percentage
of their workforce be women or black, or employees should be hired and valued
regardless of their gender or the color of their skin?


### Hypocrisy

> It is always easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.
>
> Alfred Adler

People think everything is free until they have to pay for it. When the government intervenes, is doesn't have that direct impact.
If you care about something, there is for sure a way you can help, without forcing everyone else to commit as you.

If so, how much more important?

As John Hick once stated, God allows suffering, by creating us "imperfect and immature", so
that humanity might grow and develop towards a genuine understanding and perception of the Creation.
This could only be accomplished with free will, since otherwise, if we were either perfect or we had
only one choice, our existence wouldn't be of much value.


## Possible solutions
1. The pinnacle of competition: ciudades estado
   http://cityobservatory.org/about/
   http://www.seasteading.org/
   The amount of power an organization should have should be inversely
   proportional to the amount of people it affects or controls. In other words give
   more power to local governments over federal governments.
2. Virtual worlds.
   Let's face it, the future is [non-human][6]. Artificial beings will rule eventually,
   and the only place left for mankind in the evolution race is to somehow merge with these superior forms of
   life. Inmersive virtual reality offers an interesting solution to how this
   process should happen, by hosting our human brains as software and letting us
   live as a god in your own universe.


## Conclusion

The pursuit of universal justice and equality is futile. It can only be
approximated by certain metrics, laws, to an agreed ideal that might change over
time and is prone to subjective interpretation. There is no justice. Justice
should be provided in ways that competes with other views or understandings of
the same concept.

The availability of choices cannot guarantee, but increases the chances of
prosperity in a free society, in the long term and even in an unfair system, by
enabling ideas to be probed in competition with other alternatives.

It's the competition, [stupid][2].
