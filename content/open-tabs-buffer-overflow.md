## The interwebs and the power it holds

There is so much out there and just a click of distance. Funny videos, new
music, interesting articles, tutorials, blog posts, games.

So now I have lots of open tabs that I would like to close some day but there is
always new content that keeps being added to my information processing buffer
AKA open tabs buffer.


## Why do I even check reddit/hackernews?
Partly becouse it's addictive. Small dosis of information of stuff I like,
injected right to my brain. But mostly it's becouse this way, I feel less guilty
about procrastinating.


## Ideas for surviving an open tabs buffer overflow.

[Triage mode][1] for new content, is my current approach. If I find something 
that could be benefitial at some point, I throw it in the bookmarks limbo 
(that place where goes everything I will never read), and I feel released that 
it is in a safe place, and eventually I will read it.

Also:

* Don't check for rss/newsletters/twitter/hackernews/reddit. You don't really 
  need them, trust me.
* Fresh start. Don't reopen last tabs every session.  This will help you forget 
  what wasn't important when you open the browser and read what is important before 
  closing the browser.
* Limit the number of browser tabs with a plugin.
* Use a read-it-later diggesting tool (like [Pocket][2]), which also removes the 
  comments and ads cutter from your read.


## Update 2016-04-03

So far my biggest improvements have come from the read-it-later solution, mainly
because I can tag articles to easily find later like: `server` (for server setup
and sysadmin tasks), `python`, `uix` (for ui/ux), `management` (everything
related to managing projects/people), among others. The hardest part here is to
remember that you once saved something interesting for later read.

The other improvement has been to stop using the desktop to browse twitter.
Instead I force myself to read it on a tablet, which is not so distracting and
at the same time helps with the *triage process* since it is somewhat cumbersome
to multitask on it.
