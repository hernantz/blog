Summary: Books, series, games and movies reviews. Part 2.
Status: draft

I've asked myself: why not simply put movie reviews on imdb, book reviews on
goodreads, and so on?

A veces eso es exactamente lo que hago, pero sucede que mis reviews pueden no
ser muy constructivos en el sentido que esos sitios quieren, y otras veces mis
reviews no cumplen con los terminos y condiciones impuestas por ese sitio para
aceptar una review, y estoy de acuerdo con ellas!

Asi que muchas veces lo unico que hago en esos sitios es dar mi puntuacion pero
no escribir una review.

Ademas escribir un review sin spoilear es muy dificil para mi, por lo que esto
mas que reviews deberian llamarse comments.

## La piel que habito 3.6
La pelicula de a ratos se pone lenta y densa.
Es como que se van abriendo muchos hilos para tomar y luego termina.
Uno piensa que la pelicula es sobre uno de esos hilos, pero luego cambia y vuelve a cambiar
esos hilos son interesantes, pero al 4 cambio un piensa que la pelicula se esta haciendo larga.
Pero de todas formas no deja de ser interesante.
Pero en general es muy recomendable, y abre el hilo de discusion sobre: te enamorarias de una
mujer que alguna vez fue hombre?

## Contact 4.2
How come nobody know how the machine is supposed to work o what would happen?
If everything was a hoax, then it should have been detected the very moment
they determined the source of the signal. Also it's very unlikely that someone
can fool the scientific community worldwide. That is my response to those who
think that we never made it to the Mooon.
I like how the main character expresses this duality of being skeptical but,
at the same time, always having the need for something to believe in.


## Ananias Roguelike 4

## Drive  3.4
Se parece mucho al GTA, esta bien que el tipo sea rudo e inteligente, pero
el solo matar a los mafiosos es demasiado.

## American Sniper 1.8
I really expected more from Eastwood. Las escenas con el carnicero de Bagdag
son muy rebuscadas.

## Full metal jacket 4.8
Best movie I've seen about Vietnam and war in general.
Muestra lo que es la guerra moderna (y televisada) de una forma clara y objetiva.
In this movie there are no heroes, there are no good guys, there are no bad guys.
Por poco no es un documental.
It would have been nice to show a bit of how the war was lived in the US. Like
getting private jocket back to home and show that.

# The wind through the keyhole
Excelent fantasy story that definetly should have been part of the Dark Tower original books.
I loved specially how the story is narrated by folding a tale inside a tale.
The wind throw the Keyhole has nothing to envy from traditional fairy tales like Hansel & Gretel or
Little Red Ridinghood.
**score**: 4.8

# The dark tower series
No voy a hacer un review por cada libro de la serie, porque son muchos y algunos
ya los lei hace mucho. Pero si puedo hacer un review general.
creo que voy a ser muy negativo con el review porque el ultimo libro me dejo un trago amargo
Stephen empezo un proyecto muy ambicioso y no lo pudo controlar, no porque cada vez hubiera
mejores ideas, sino porque no sabia como terminarlo y sacarselo de encima. 
Here is my attempt at fixing everything: I wold leave the first and second books as is, since they are brillant
(you can almost feel the effect of drugs kicking in Stephen's mind).
I would have never resurrected Jake, this would be Roland's secret to this ka-tet,
and later confess to father Kalahan to stop having nightmares, and I would forget about the whole idea of 19, The Wizzard of Oz, Ka-tet Corp, Randall Flagg and Dixie Pig.
I would also never put Shardik into the story so that the Guardians of The Beam would be left as a myth. But I'm unsure about Mordred.
The Wastelands is where the story starts to deteriorate.

On my version of the story, on the third book, the wind through the keyhole, they get to Calla, the far end of their known Mid-World.
Here is a great oportunity to get to know Roland's past in depth. In this book, "Ka is a wheel", he faces ones again
a small town that first distrust him and he is not well received.
He narrates the wind through the keyhole to the town folks, dances the Commalah, and wins their trust.
He later tells a more intimate audience (just his ka-tet plus father Callahan?) about his past, Susan Delgado, and
how he killed his mother. He's ka-tet, and specially the readers, understand why Roland is how he is, and why he wants
to set the Tower aside to help this town, to redeem himself. As Einstein said: Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

The next book, *Wolfs of Calla*, they fight these wolfs that steal their kids.
But Eddie and Susannah die in this fight, they were not true knights after all. Their bodies are burried with their guns, and roses are planted in their graves.
Ka is a wheel, and again, for saving the day, he must pay with blood of his loved ones.
He hungs the traitor, and leaves the town with Oy, Aunt Talitha's cross, his guns, the Horn of Arthur Eld and the black orb towards Lud, where the wolfs came from.

And now comes *Wastelands*. In Lud, we enjoy all the post-apocaliptic cyberpunk goodness. Gangs stealed kids to enlarge their armies,
and some of them where offered to the Crimson King's monks.
In this book, Oy dies (his last word is "tower"), because of the injuries he received while attacking Tik-Tak, who also dies.

Finally, in the Dark Tower book, he leaves the dead city with Blaine, and beats the trian with a stupid riddle Curthbert once told him.
and he is left in the crystal castle of Discordia in Thunderclap. There he find mentalists monks that are breaking the Beams.
He also finds the door to The Dark Tower, the only one in Mid-World, and puts the black orb into some kind of placeholder to open it.

Roland reaches the Tower alone, as when he started his journey. He blows the Eld's Horn to open it and leaves Talitha's cross in the floor.
At the top of the tower he founds Stephen King as being the Crimson King (kings..., see the pun here?).
The Mad King, creates universes, casts shadows in them, and forces others to do his bidding and works behind the scenes, in his writings.
They have a conversation similar to the one with the Man in Black, where King says
that he might be Gan but his crazy side at the same time, “There's someone greater than me. Remember Gunslinger,
the greatest mystery the universe offers is not life but size. Size encompasses life, and the Tower encompasses size.”.
He wants to detroy the tower in the sense that he is tired of carring the burden of writing about it.
Roland asks him to restore the world and Crimson King agrees to do so, but only if Roland gives his life as
sacrifice so that Stephen can put Mid-World to rest and his mind at ease. Roland accepts the deal, shouts the names of all his friends and deaths ones,
(new roses appear in the field for every name he yells) and shoots the Mad King dead, which also causes his own death. Both gain absolution.
We see that all the roses that surround the Tower belong to someone whose name has been spoken inside, in another story, in another universe perhaps.
The story ends with Roland's bones lying at the top of the Dark Tower for all the eternity.
Now the sandalwood door of the Tower reads something in the lines of: "Here lays Roland Deschain of Gilead, son of Steven,
last in the line of Eld, protector of the Dark Tower".

With this twist in the story I have remarked the main ideas that are present throughout all the books:
* "There are other worlds than these".
* Ka is a wheel.
* Size is the greatest mistery the Universe offers.

*score: 2.9*


# the dirties

# Iron Maiden: Book of Souls
Esperaba mucho mas, especialmente despues de haber escuchado y visto speed of light. Es realmente espectacular
pero no tiene nada que ver con el resto del album. Es mas parece que fuese algo que encajaria mejor en el cd anterior.
Con la tematica del espacio. This is the album savior, followed by Death or Glory. The man of sorrows outstands as a good tune too.

Todo el resto de los temas se sienten como pedazos de melodia unidas interesantes pero unidas en temas demasiado largos.
Por ejemplo, The Red and the Black is good, but i'm seek of the *uoohh uoooh* and man, but rythms are repeated up to 4 times between
each sung part, which makes tracks unncessarily long, 13 minutes in this case. 13 minutes?

Empire of the clouds is interesting but has a really messy begining that doesn't convince at all. It would
have been better if it had way less vocals, just some simple chorus and some spoken words, and leave the
song to be almost instrumental with epic guitar solos and piano pieces.

Shadows of the valley sound the same as "the chosen one"
When the river runs deep parece un tema de A matter of life and death.

# CitizenFour
Despite being a documentary it didn't cause any sensation on me so it lacks the impact it should have because of the topic
it develops. Moreover, almost 2 hours of video felt like too much.
*score: 2.2*


# The others

# Guardians of the galaxy

# Sicario 4.6


# Star Wars the force awakens
La pelicula esta pensada para movilizar los sentimientos de los fans, reviviendo personajes, frases, lugares, etc.
Encontre algunos errores en el argumento que son errores incluso dentro de la fantasia propuesta por la saga, 
por ejemplo Finn pelea de igual a igual ante Ken hacia el final de la pelicula, siendo que es un soldado raso.
All and all is an entretaning movie and I'm glad the star wars saga is back. 
*score: 3.7*


# Glengerry Glen Ross
Una pelicula que propone un darwinismo capitalista salvaje de oficina, donde las mentiras y los puniales en la espalda
es moneda comun. Excelentes acutuaciones e inolvidables dialogos. La historia es algo lineal pero entretenida y deja lugar
para algunas sorpresas.
*score: 4.7*


# Birdman
Es delirante e intensa, pero cierra como pelicula alternativa, entretenida e interesante a lo mainstream.
*score: 3.9*


# Megadeth: Dystopia
No gusta la voz de Mustaine, era mejor la voz aguda, chillona y enojada de los primeros cds.
En cuanto los temas entan buenos de a partes, el comienzo de este, el riff de aquel, etc, pero ningun
tema convence demasiado.
**score: 3.9**


# Como hacer amigos e influir en los demas
Un libro muy recomendable, El titulo es un poco marketinero, no se trata de hacer amigos e influir en los demas, pero
da razones y ejemplos para evitar roces innecesarios, causar una buena impresion, no quedar mal y ser mas inteligente al tratar con los demas,
que no es poco. Uno aplicando estos principios tiene mas chances de tener exito que no aplicandolos.


# cloverfield 2.5

# spinal tap 4.2

# Goodbye mommy 4.8

# Abbath
This album is fucking superb. Abbath's singular and demonic voice and his unique style for
creating dark songs that are both catchy and brutal at the same time, has made this album
to keep up with the quality of the legendary band Immortal.
**score: 4.9**

# The man from earth
La pelicula es corta y fluida y no deja de ser interesante a pesar de ser un grupo de personas
hablando, en una habitacion.
Jesus es negado tres veces.
Algunos detalles que hacen ruido: 14000 anos es muchisimo, quizas hacer que el tipo tuviese
3 mil anos hubiese sido mejor, el final me hubiese gustado que quedase abierto y no me cerro
la idea de que el psicologo hubiese perdido a su mujer justo el dia antes.
**score: 4.5**

# Batman vs Superman
Ambicious movie lots side stories that happen so quick that don't end up fitting well together
when seing the entire movie.
Scenes and dialogs that didn't fit well together, the stories doesn't develop coherently.
Batman is the best character in the movie, and it's battle with superman is really good too.
I think that they should have fought with the evil scientist and not Doomsday whoose animation
looked more false than Hulk's.
**score: 3**


# The witch
The acting is superb and the movie is really good at showing the dark imagery and the extreme relegious perilous way of life helps create a soffocating
atmosphere where the each one's dark side starts to fluorish, with lies and sinful thoughts, to
reach a climax where faith in God and the family vanishes.
I would have liked the movie to not fall into the obvious and simplest ending in which the
devil is tangible and real, but instead, leave the sensation to the viewer that the witch was
never real, but a product of the family's mystical delirum.
**score: 4.2**


# Feast for crows
Es interesante ver que en este libro se desarrollan las historias de personajes secundarios
unicamente. Si bien algunos son mucho mas interesantes (como James y Cercei) que otros (como Sansa y Victarion),
RR Martin siempre se las ingenia para mantenerte enganchado y entretenido.
This one wasn't as good as the previous one.
**score: 3.5**


# Cloverfield 10 Lane
No me gusto mucho cloverfield, pero esta pelicula no esta plantada como una
secuela.  Lo que sucede en el mundo cloverfield (yes, a new franchise has been
born) es simplemente una excusa para contar un es un thriller inteligente, y
digo inteligente porque las acutuaciones son bastante realistas (No mas
Scream), y el personaje psycho esta muy bien logrado ya que nunca estas muy
seguro de como juzgarlo, si como un loco o alguien cuerdo.  Ya que todos
estamos un poco locos, o un poco cuerdos, y eso se evidencia mas en situaciones
poco comunes.  Si tengo para criticar que el final me parecio bastante fuera de
lugar, es decir no encaja con el realismo logrado en el resto de la peli.

Una pelicula muy recomendable.
**score: 4.9**


# Green room
The best the movie has to offer are the realistic deaths and action scenes.
The plot was rather interesting, though it started getting really absurd
by the last quarter of the movie. One extra point becouse I heard a Slayer
song in the background.
**score: 3.2**

# Hateful eight
There are a few plot-holes I would like to point out. The main one being
why it took so long for the villains gang to kill the captors. And the
other one being why did the hangman play his role so well, even when
he tried to stop major Warren to kill the old general.
Also when John Ruth gets poisoned and starts hitting his captive, the
gang members do nothing, even seeing that the girls life was in danger.
It would have been more realistic if the hangman and the general arrived
after the gang (the french guy, the cowboy and Bob) murdered everyone,
so the non-gang party outnumbered the villains 2 to 1.
This way the hangman would be genuine, and the general wouldn't have to
be pretending that nothing happened.
All in all I enjoyed every single scene and dialog of this movie for it's
almost three hours duration.
**score: 4.1**

# Welcome to the dungeon
It's fun, fast to play and easy to understand. The art of the cards if really
good and the gameplay is balanced.  It would have been nice to have some rules
about how to select the champion so you are always forced to change it and it
would've been awesome if the rules book included modified lyrics of welcome to
the jungle.
**score: 4.3**

# Stranger things
It's a mix of many movies and books containing a good deal of pop culture,
monsters, alternative dimensions, an evil goverment agency, secret experiments,
science, teenage romances and even more nerdy stuff and references (yes, it's
got DoD too), with stereotypical characters and chiché scenes that besides
being so predictable, it's still enjoyable.  The storyline is simple and there
is nothing left for the viewer to digest, no homework, so you just watch it and
try to guess what's going to happen or which movie or book you've seen that
before.
**score: 4.5**

# Black mirror
It's like the new Twilight Zone, but revisited. Each episode is different, but
there is still common background theme of matching technology and the dark side
of mankind, which is very well achieved in the sense that after watching an
episode you are left anguished.  Love the fact that there some small details
that can be noticed in different episodes like playing "anyone who knows what
love is" or showing the same pregnancy test device.  Besides the fact that
there might be plot holes and some episodes are better done others, all things
considered, Black Mirror is highly enjoyable.
**score: 4.6**

# The loft
Besides all the plot twists, it wasn't good enough to make a memorable movie.
The acting wasn't that realistic, I didn't buy the idea of "we are friends".
And one of the characters was trying to copy Kevin Spacey in *The Usual
Suspects*.
**score: 3.0**

# Don't Breathe
The level of suspense this movie achieves makes you hold your breathe the whole
length. But when it comes to characters, I don't buy the idea of smart white
guys being burglars. I guess they had force it this way for you to feel empathy
for them and to make them work their way out of the complicated situation they
get into.  It's worth watching, but just once in your life I guess.
**score: 3.5**

# Arrival
The movie requires you to take some time to process it, and for sure a second
watch.  It is similar to Interstellar in the sense that at first is highly
scientific and by the end it turns into an emotional drama.  The acting of the
main character is great, it makes you feel anxious and scared all the first
part of the movie when the first encounter happens.  The second part of the
movie in which they learn their language is a bit unclear, how much time it
took? There is an explanation provided by the movie which is: learning a new
language rewires your brain, and that also gives her the ability to see the
future, and those visions could also be interpreted as a product of being
overworked and lack of sleep.

I would have liked that scientists started communicating secretively and that
is how they would gain more understanding of the alien language.

The last part is: if you knew what's going to happen, would you change
anything?  I liked the concept, but I didn't buy the scene of convincing
China's prime minister to end the conflict. Maybe this could have been a mix of
convincing the mission's major she had daily contact with, and, again,
international collaboration from all scientists involved.

The aliens, the spaceships, the alien language are also great.
**score: 4.3**

# Bojack Horseman
Bojack is the opposite of King Midas, he destroys everything he touches.
It's funny, depressing and bizarre but realistic at the same time. You'll need
some good dosses of popular culture to understand some of the references.
The mix of animals and humans adds a lot to the show.
**score: 4.1**

# Alien Resurrection
I'm a firm believer that the whole franchise is set upon great ideas but the
movies are not that great.  Aliens and Alien Resurrection confirm that. The
scenes are not well put together, stupid characters that do stupid things for
no reason, catchy frases all over, etc.  It's kind of interesting to see that
all the movies have a lot in common, yeah, not just the xenomorphs, but the
stages of the movie. Skepticism, the alien breakout, the hunting, and the
destructive ending, with an android, of course.
Extra point for the human-alien.
**score: 2.8**

# Valley of Violence
Why is it that all western movies have to look like the good, the bad and the
ugly?  Might be because it was the apotheosis of western movies. So yeah,
Valley of Violence is a western, with the good guy, the bad guys and also the
ugly.  The extremely intelligent dog was a good and funny addition.  Now last
two fights could have been more realistic, because puting a rope around
someones neck and hanging him by surprise is not something you would count on
to kill your enemy.
**score: 3.7**

# Oculous
A hunted mirror that feeds from plants and animals and can give powerful
alusinations is an insteresting idea for a horror movie. But if that mirror is
too powerful that nobody can do anything about it, it becomes a borring
massacre. Also, wtf with the wife that gets possesed and wants to kill her
kids?
**score: 2.8**

# Exploding kittens
Everyone loves this game, is fast and funny, which makes it a great filler. The
only addition I would suggest is to add a ressurection card so that players
that got eliminated can stay tuned for that card to appear and get back into
the game.
**score: 4.5**

# Omnium Gatherum: Gray Heavens
I can see this band getting better and better release after release.  Their
last work is a masterpiece. The voice, the melody, everything has that power
that goes through your body and leaves you with goosebumps. I had the chance
to see them live and the sensation they left on me was the exact same one.
**score: 4.7**

# ...And justice for all
People tend to idealize justice and goverments. This movie shows that behind
all that there's normal people, which doesn't exclude and often involves
things like burocracy, corruption, mediocricy, and backstabbing.
Al Pacino's acting is superb.
**score: 4.3**
