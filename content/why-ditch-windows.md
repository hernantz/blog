Summary: My answer to the OS switching dilemma. 
Status: draft


I won't give reasons to you to ditch Windows, but rather my answer to 
the OS switching dilemma.

Mainstream OSes (OS X, windows and ubuntu) can provide a great or an awful 
experience, give you headaches and bring you satisfactions. 

It is not what features each OS has, but what is your willingness to solve 
the problems you will likely find in your way. 
An this applies exactly for almost anything.

At the university, we got ubuntu in the library's PCs. A friend of mine wanted 
to open a pdf file in those and for some x reason he couldn't. He told me: 
"What!....is this linux? Linux sucks, I can't even open a pdf file!" 
I'm pretty sure his conclusions would have been different if the same experience 
had happened in his Windows 7 notebook.

People are not rationale when making decitions. Some people don't care if apps are open-source or not, 
they want them to just work, or sometimes they want to be on fashion becouse 
everyone is using it.

Even some people can live and think in three parallel dimensions, which allows 
them to love the open source philosophy, use windows and want to have a mac.

Let him decide. Better than giving reasons for using or not using <insert OS here>, 
I would just say: "Switch if you want, and use it on your own risk, as I did"

I switched to Ubuntu.
