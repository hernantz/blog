This is my static new blog and it begins with this single post. I hope this is
not one of those things I start and abandon.

Why now? Because in the last weeks I felt the urge to write for myself.
Knowing my thoughts will be publicly available forces me to think wisely, 
and arrive to better conclusions, inpired by [this][2] and [this][4].

Additionally, until now didn't like any of the blogging platforms out there,
but now with [pelican][1], being able to craft my own posts with markdown and
vim has become part of the motivation too.
