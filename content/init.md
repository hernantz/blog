Summary: Short version for index and feeds

This is my not-sexy new blog. It starts with a single post and a single 
blog, but eventually would like this to become a planet of blogs.


Why now? Becouse in the last weeks I felt the urge to write for myself. 
Knowing my thoughts will be publicly available forces me to think wisely, 
and arrive to better conclusions. 
Aditionally, until now didn't like any of the blogging platforms out there, 
with pelican I'm being able to craft my own posts with python and vim 
is also is part of the motivation.
