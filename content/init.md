Summary: This is my new static blog.

This is my static new blog and it begins with this single post. I hope this is
not one of those things I start and abandon.

Why now? Because in the last weeks I felt the urge to write for myself.
Knowing my thoughts will be publicly available forces me to think wisely, 
and arrive to better conclusions. 
Additionally, until now didn't like any of the blogging platforms out there,
but now with [pelican][1], being able to craft my own posts with markdown and
vim has become part of the motivation too.

I know I should [write less][2], but it's possible that this will be the
shortest post in here. But still, I'll do my best to get to the point. Give you
quality over quantity. Why write a thousand words if a picture says more than a
thousand words? Why write six paragraphs if you can fit an introduction, the
main idea and a conclusion in just three?
