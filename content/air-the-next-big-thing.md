What is wrong with startups today?

Slack is [valuated at $1.12b][4].
While freenode hosts ~55846 chat rooms and ~89238 users, or even when
[this kind of software][1] is available for free and you can move your 
entire team there, as you did when you moved to Slack.
It's not like Twitter or Youtube where you have a comunity around the
service and it's kind of unlikely there would be a massive migration to
other service.
In Slack, the number of users doesn't matter, because is a team
communication tool, and as soon as the team decides to move elsewhere,
Slack is dead.

I give you another example. Docker, [said to be valuated at $1b][5]. 
Provides an open source tool on top other open source tool, which 
apparently [is not even needed now][2], thanks to the systemd guys.
Even if Docker tries to provide a web platform, similar to what GitHub 
does for git, does that really justifies $1b valuation?

Ladies and gentlemen I'm here to sell you air.
A product everyone needs. We currently have 7 billion active users and
growing. Nobody is paying for it yet, but this userbase's got to worth
something, plus we have no competitors.
