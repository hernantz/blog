*What would you like to do with your life?* is the question I fear the most when
meeting new people (that ask that kind of questions), because I simply don't
have an easy answer.

So far I can tell three things about me, that might help you understand where
I'm heading to.

I'm a generalist, which sound great until you realise it is actually a burden.
One might think that a generalist can contribute everywhere, but in reality you
never end up fiting anywhere. It's easy to wander, so my life is a constant
struggle to keep a goal, discipline myself and take baby steps towards
somewhere.

I don't fear learning whatever is needed to assert the success of a project.
Indeed, I love to learn. Maybe I don't like to be taught, though very often I
see the need for that.

My tombstone will say:

> Intenté hacer de este un mundo mejor para todos y terminé
> creando un infierno para mí solo.
