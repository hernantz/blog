Summary: Allow me to introduce myself

One way to get to know someone is to asks about his aspirations.

*What would you like to do with your life?* is the question I fear the most when
meeting new people (that ask that kind of questions), because I simply don't
have an easy answer.

So far I can tell three things about me, that might help you understand why.

I'm a generalist (like everyone else?), which sounds great until you realize it
is actually a burden. One might think that a generalist can contribute
*everywhere*, but in reality you never end up fitting *anywhere*. It's easy to
wander. My life is a constant struggle to keep a goal, discipline myself and
take baby steps towards *somewhere*.

I don't fear learning whatever is needed to assert the success of a project.
Indeed, I love to learn.

My tombstone will say [^1]:

> Intenté hacer de este mundo un paraíso para todos y terminé creando un
> infierno para mí solo.
