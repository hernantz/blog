Summary: A summary about me
Status: hidden


Disclaimer: This page is *in permanent draft status*.
*tl;dr*: I'm a generalist. I'm doomed.

What do you do? is the question I fear most when meeting new people, because
I simply don't have an elegant (eternal?) answer.
So far what I can tell is that I'm a generalist, which sound great until you
realise it is actually a burden. Uno cree que puede aportar en muchos lados pero
la realidad es que uno termina de encajar en ningun lado, and it's easy to wander,
so my life is a constant struggle to keep a goal, discipline myself and take
baby steps towards awesomeness.

I don't fear learning whatever is needed to assert the success of a project.
Indeed, I love to learn, I don't like to be taught, though very often I see
the need for that.

regularly set myself a personal challenge and attack it daily.

My tombstone will say:

> Intenté hacer de este un mundo mejor para todos y terminé
> creando un infierno para mí solo.
