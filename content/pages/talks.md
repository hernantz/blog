## The ring goes south

In the early days, Django didn't ship a built-in migrations framework. South
was the most popular app to do that. This talk exposed some common pitfalls and
quirks, some of them might still apply to newer Django versions. The title is
based on a song from the Lord Of the Rings soundtrack.

This talk was given at an in-company session at Machinalis offices
(2014-04-30).


## Cada mock es un moco

While sometimes mocks are needed, they should not be the first tool you use to
write tests. In this talk I try to explain why It is a pity to be mocking your
code when you could be writing meaningful tests at *almost* the same cost.  The
title reffers to moco (snot in spanish) and mock being *homonyms*. The contents
of this talk are based on the contents of this post: [Mock yourself not your
tests][5].

This talk was given at an in-company session at Machinalis offices
(2015-07-27).


## Tenemos que dejar de escribir else por dos a√±os

In Python we strongly emphasize that code must be elegant and easy to
interpret, but with PEP8 alone is not enough, many times our logic can be
nested in a cataract of if(s) and else(s) difficult to maintain. In this talk
we explored some strategies to avoid that unnecessary complexity.

This talk was given at the first [Cordoba Python Meetup][0] (2015-12-04).


## El fin esta cerca!

2012 passed and the world did not end. Well, scheduling the next world's
doomsday can be tricky, because working with dates is so. In this talk I try to
share some basic tips and gotchas I learned the hard way while building a
calendaring app, that hopefully will make this task easier for you. The
contents of this talk are based on this post: [Calendaring events with
Python][1].

This talk was given at an in-company session at Machinalis offices
(2017-04-13) and at [Pycon Argentina 2017][2] (2017-11-17).


## Una config.py para configurarlos a todos

Configuration management, understood as a way to alter the behavior of a
program without changing the code, is a mechanism that requires a well thought
architecture. In this talk I focus on static configuration in general, and an
approach for python. The contents of this talk are based on this post: [One
config.py to configure them all][3]. The title refers to The Lord of the Rings
inscription: *"... One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring
to bring them all and in the darkness bind them"*.

This talk was given at [Pyday La Plata 2018][4] (2018-05-12) and [PyconAr Buenos
Aires 2019][6] (2019-12-06).

## Djangonautas! No dejen que djangonautas escriban Javascript!

Knowing Javascript has become indispensable for web development, but perhaps too
complicated, to the point that there is something known as javascript fatigue.
In recent times, libraries and frameworks have emerged that propose a pattern
more similar to how the websites of before were, but without skimping on the
dynamism of modern websites. In this talk we discuss patterns and libraries such
as htmx, django-unicorn, etc. designed to make a Django website more dynamic.

This talk was given at [PyconAr 2021][7] (2021-10-26) and it's based on the blog
post [Djangonauts! Don't let djangonauts write Javascript!][8] and can be watch
online on [Youtube][9].
