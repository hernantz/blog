## The ring goes south


## Cada mock es un moco

While sometimes mocks are needed, they should not be the first tool you use to
write tests. In this talk I try to explain why It is a pity to be mocking your
code when you could be writing meaningful tests at *almost* the same cost. 

This talk was given at an in-company session at Machinalis offices
(2015-07-27).


## Tenemos que dejar de escribir else por dos a√±os

In Python we strongly emphasize that code must be elegant and easy to
interpret, but with PEP8 alone is not enough, many times our logic can be
nested in a cataract of if(s) and else(s) difficult to maintain. In this talk
we explored some strategies to avoid that unnecessary complexity.

This talk was given at the first [Cordoba Python Meetup][0] (2015-12-04).


## El fin esta cerca! 

2012 passed and the world did not end. Well, scheduling the next world's
doomsday can be tricky, because working with dates is so. In this talk I try to
share some basic tips and gotchas I learned the hard way while building a
calendaring app, that hopefully will make this task easier for you. The
contents of this talk are based on this post: [Calendaring events with
Python][1].

This talk was given at an in-company session at Machinalis offices
(2017-04-13) and at [Pycon Argentina 2017][2] (2017-11-17).
