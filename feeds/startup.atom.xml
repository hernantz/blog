is a technique born in the Lean Startup movement to reduce the risk of gaining validated
learning, without spending too much effort, money and time in the wrong project direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You build a MVP to validate an idea, be it for a brand new product or a new feature 
in an existing one. 
In this stage of the project you don't care about: tests, QA, copy-pasting code, 
mocking the UI, security, code reviews, maintainability, scalability, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case this prototype is successfull, you should go and build the product or the feature to 
capitalize that validated learning, but this time, following industries best practices, 
so it can be used in production by you (paying?) users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last step is crucial. There will be the tempatation of not taking it.
The consequences of not doing it are well known, that's why we have best practices afterall.
The risk is low now. Money, time and effort won't be wasted. Go build it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="startup"></category></entry></feed>
