is a technique born in the Lean Startup movement to reduce the risk of gaining validated
learning, without spending too much effort, money and time in the wrong project direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You build a MVP to validate an idea, be it for a brand new product or a new feature 
in an existing one. 
In this stage of the project you don't care about: tests, QA, copy-pasting code, 
mocking the UI, security, code reviews, maintainability, scalability, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case this prototype is successfull, you should go and build the product or the feature to 
capitalize that validated learning, but this time, following industries best practices, 
so it can be used in production by your (paying?) users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last step is crucial. There will be the tempatation of not taking it.
The consequences of not doing it are well known, that's why we have best practices afterall.
The risk is low now. Money, time and effort won't be wasted. There is no excuse. 
An MVP is not a product, it's an MVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">hernantz</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2013 12:03:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-11-09:an-mvp-is-not-a-product-its-an-mvp.html</guid><category>startups</category></item><item><title>Sorry for the length of this post</title><link>/sorry-for-the-length-of-this-post.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I didn't have the time to make it shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I do my best to get to the point. Quality over quantity.
Why write a thousand words if a picture says more than a thousand words? 
Why write six paragraphs if you can fit an introduction, main idea 
and conclusion in just three?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is short, read this and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href="http://getnashty.com/write-less"&gt;write less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">hernantz</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 22:56:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-08-30:sorry-for-the-length-of-this-post.html</guid><category>personal</category></item><item><title>Open tabs buffer overflow</title><link>/open-tabs-buffer-overflow.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;The interwebs and the power it holds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much out there and just a click of distance.
Fun videos, new music, interesting articles, tutorials, blog posts, games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I have lots of open tabs that I would like to close some day but there is
always new content that keeps being added to my information processing buffer 
aka open tabs buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do i even check reddit/hackernews?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly becouse It's addictive. Small dosis of information of stuff I like, injected right to my brain. 
But mostly becouse, this way, I feel less guilty about procrastinating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ideas for surviving an open tabs buffer overflow.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage" title="Triage mode"&gt;Triage mode&lt;/a&gt; for new content is my current approach. If I find something that could be 
benefitial at some point, I throw it in the bookmarks limbo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookmarks. That place where goes everything I will never read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until then I know is on a safe place, just in case. Also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't check for rss/newsletters/twitter/hackernews/reddit. You don't really need them, trust me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh start. Don't reopen last tabs every session. 
  This will help you forget what wasn't important when you open the browser
  and read what is important before closing the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit browser tabs with a plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a read-it-later diggesting tool (like pocket), which also removes the comments and 
  ads cutter from your read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">hernantz</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 22:56:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-08-21:open-tabs-buffer-overflow.html</guid><category>productivity</category><category>ideas</category></item><item><title>Init</title><link>/init.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is my not-sexy static new blog. It starts with a single post and a single
blog. I hope this is not one of those things I start and abandon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why now? Becouse in the last weeks I felt the urge to write for myself. 
Knowing my thoughts will be publicly available forces me to think wisely, 
and arrive to better conclusions. 
Aditionally, until now didn't like any of the blogging platforms out there, 
but now with pelican, being able to craft my own posts with markdown and vim
is also part of the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">hernantz</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 18:06:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-07-03:init.html</guid><category>pelican</category><category>personal</category></item></channel></rss>
